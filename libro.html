      Prefacio
    </h2>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      Una tarde estaba ensayando coro de nuestras niñas en la Trinity Church I en Princeton; estábamos cantando a coro desde el Requiem de Durufle. Las chicas eran maravillosas. Su tono de voz era exquisita, su expresión era sensible, las notas estaban en lo cierto, y el ambiente era emocionante. A mitad de camino a través de uno de los coros Irene Willis, mi socio, entró y se quedó allí en silencio, escuchando.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
		Cuando terminamos me dijo, "Maravilloso! ¿Cuánto tiempo ha estado ensayando eso?"    
	</p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Las chicas estaban cantando de un vistazo," respondí con considerable orgullo. "Ellos nunca lo han visto antes."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "No hay muchos coros que puedan hacer eso, ¿o si?" , dijo con entusiasmo. (Irene es muy buena para los cumplidos.) "¿Por qué no hay más de ellos?"
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "No tengo idea", le contesté. "Todo parece tan obvio para mí y para las niñas."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Deberías escribir un libro", respondió ella, "que nos diga cómo lo hace."

      El Inicio
    </h2>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
            ÉRASE UNA VEZ, había un estudiante de música que deseaba convertirse en un director de coro éxito, sobre todo de los coros de niños. Cuando era niño, cantaba en un coro de la iglesia local y aprendió a amar las prácticas semanales con sus amigos. El coro fue realizado por una mujer amable que amaba a su coro, amaba su música, y amaba a su iglesia. Ella no era especialmente hábil en la formación del coro, pero su atención a todos los involucrados con el programa de coro ayudó a hacer todas las prácticas y el servicio especial. El estudiante deseaba formar un coro como ella lo hizo, pero hacerlo mejor, mucho mejor.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
    		Cuando se graduó de la escuela secundaria, se matriculó como estudiante en la universidad de música donde estaba seguro de que iba a aprender todo lo que necesitaba saber sobre el entrenamiento del coro. Pero no funciona así. El estudiante aprendió a tocar Bach y Messiaen muy bien y disfrutó de muchas conferencias fascinantes de inspirar a los profesores, pero no se le enseña cómo entrenar a los niños que no conocían la música. 
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      		"Esto es lo que necesito saber", pensó, "porque esta es la situación I se enfrento cuando me gradúe y salgo al mundo real!"
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
			Él cantaba en la coral de la universidad y se emocionó cuando llegó el momento de los conciertos en la ciudad cuando los cantantes estuvieron acompañados por orquestas cualificados y dirigidos por inspirar a los conductores. Él aprendió mucho sobre la historia de la música y cómo producir su voz, pero no tenía ni idea de lo que iba a hacer cuando se enfrenta a un coro de su cuenta, algunos de los cuales se capacitó a los cantantes.
			"¿Qué le diría a ellos en mi primera práctica?" , se preguntó. "No tengo idea de cómo organizar un programa de coro o de la forma de motivar a los niños a querer llegar a un ensayo del coro en una húmeda noche del lunes!"
    </p>
    <div style="visibility: hidden; height: 0; width: 0;" id="page0012" title="pagetype_txt">
    </div>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      		Para ver qué podía aprender, visitó coros de las iglesias en los pueblos cercanos que tenían programas para niños. Él aprendió mucho, sobre todo lo que no se debe hacer!
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
         	Él asistió a una práctica de coro en el que el director del coro tenía dificultades para controlar a los niños.<sub><a href="#page0012">2</a></sub>
	     	Ellos prestaron poca o ninguna atención a lo que estaba diciendo. De hecho, los niños, no el director del coro, controlan la práctica. La mayoría de los niños se veía aburrido y sólo una o dos de las chicas mayores hicieron cualquier canto. "Yo no quiero un coro de esa manera," el pensamiento de los estudiantes.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-f-1p-v1_footnote_1_1">
      <img src="img/page0012_0000.svg" alt="" />
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      		Visitó otra iglesia<sub><a href="#page0012">3</a></sub> donde el director del coro era enérgico e inspirador. La sala de ensayo bien iluminado había colores brillantes cuadros en las paredes. Cuidadosamente dispuestos en mesas estaban glockenspiels y tambores que los niños jugaban de vez en cuando.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-f-1p-v1_footnote_1_1">
      <img src="img/page0012_0001.svg" alt="" />
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      		Disfrutaba viendo la práctica, pero se dio cuenta después de que todo había terminado que los niños realmente no habían hecho mucho cantar. Cuando lo hicieron cantar, las canciones eran musicalmente sin complicaciones y entonaron bajo, alrededor del Do central.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      		"Tenían un montón de diversión", se dijo mientras se dirigía en el autobús de vuelta a la universidad ", pero parecían ser más un club de música, tocando todos esos instrumentos. Creo que el tipo de coro que estoy apuntando para no tendría tiempo para tocar campanillas y golpear tambores, excepto en Navidad! "
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      		A medida que se bajó del autobús , pensó, " yo quiero un coro de niños que pueden cantar algunos de los mejores de la música del mundo y el que realmente disfrutar el desafío y la emoción que esto puede proporcionar. "
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      		Abrió la puerta de su habitación y miró a copias de algunas obras corales que había recogido . Eran de Bach, Haendel, Palestrina, Britten, Poulenc , Bruckner, y por muchos compositores americanos modernos, como Gerald Cercano y William Albright. "La mayoría de los niños no saben por dónde empezar si yo los entregué uno de esos, " pensó. " Algunos tienen dificultades para cantar incluso una canción sencilla con precisión. Quiero descubrir cómo puedo hacerlo mejor que eso ! "
    </p>
    <div style="visibility: hidden; height: 0; width: 0;" id="page0013" title="pagetype_txt">
    </div>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      		Con el fin de probarlo por sí mismo, el estudiante fue a su decano de los estudiantes a preguntar si podía tomar un trabajo a tiempo parcial como organista y director de coro de una iglesia local.

    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      		" Sí , por supuesto ", dijo el decano , "tengo el lugar para usted. Hay una iglesia al otro lado de la ciudad con un coro de ocho hijos y diez adultos que ensayan una vez a la semana . Hay un servicio de Domingo y el órgano no está mal, tampoco ", añadió .
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      		Fue entrevistado por el ministro y fue contratado . Él comenzaría la próxima semana .
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      		" Ahora sí que puedo empezar ", pensó con cierto entusiasmo . "Yo les voy a mostrar lo emocionante que puede ser para pertenecer a una multa coro ! "
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      		Pero su primera práctica fue un desastre. Sólo seis de los niños se presentaron , y tres de ellos llegaron tarde . Él encontró que en realidad no muestran mucho interés en el canto y presta poca atención a lo que él trató de enseñarles. Se alegró de que su práctica duró sólo media hora , pero estaba seguro de que la práctica con los adultos sería mucho mejor .
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
			No lo fue. Aunque los adultos que lo recibió amablemente en su mayor parte , el tenor claramente no le gustaba y sólo cantaba cuando le daba la gana . Varios de los altos cantaron plana y uno de los bajos no podían lanzar notas con precisión. Una de las sopranos y fue el peor de vibrato. Con todo , hicieron un ruido desagradable .    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "No son un coro ", pensó para sus adentros mientras luchaba con un himno sencillo que parecía volver a componer de nuevo cada vez que lo cantaron . "Son un conjunto de cantantes que no se mezclan , no cantan juntos, no leen música, no cantan a tono , y tienen aún menos idea de lo que es todo acerca de lo que tengo . "
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      Los niños fueron más moderadas en presencia de los adultos, pero apenas cantaron nada. No se veían en la música y tendieron a jugar cuando pensaban que no estaba buscando y, a veces , cuando sabían que era !
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      Ese fue el más largo de noventa minutos que el estudiante nunca había pasado , y él fue grandemente aliviado cuando la práctica había terminado. " ¿Es esto realmente lo que quiero hacer con el resto de mi vida? " , se preguntó mientras caminaba de vuelta a la universidad en la lluvia. "Tiene que haber respuestas en algún lugar si supiera dónde buscar. "
    </p>
    <div style="visibility: hidden; height: 0; width: 0;" id="page0014" title="pagetype_txt">
    </div>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      Durante las próximas semanas , algunas cosas mejoraron , pero otros empeoraron. Tres niños de fumar, pero uno nuevo se unieron . El nuevo chico no pudo igualar pitch pero por alguna razón que él estaba muy interesado en el coro y cantaba todo el tiempo, muy imprecisa . El estudiante descubrió que temía la práctica de los niños , porque no sabía cómo hacer para hacer que quieran aprender a cantar tres himnos cada semana .
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      " No creo que yo estaría muy interesado en pasar tiempo en una iglesia fría una vez por semana ", pensó durante uno de sus paseos de vuelta a la universidad ", si yo sabía que tenía sólo himnos para cantar , y que yo tenía que aprenderlas de memoria, línea por línea. Eso es aburrido! "
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      Descubrió que no podía mantener el orden. Los niños y niñas pasaron gran parte de su tiempo jugando. Casi nunca realmente escucharon lo que estaba diciendo. Una chica en particular fue constantemente atentos. Tenía que mantener la corrección de ella. Ella hizo lo que dijo durante un minuto más o menos , y luego una recaída por lo que tuvo que hablar con ella de nuevo. " Ella no me quiere para nada", pensó, " y me siento lo mismo por ella! " Decidió dejar la iglesia al final del semestre.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      Los adultos mejoraron . Sorprendentemente , el tenor lo invitó a cenar una noche. El estudiante descubrió que el hombre era una persona muy interesante. Había cantado en varios coros buenos cuando era más joven y se perdió el desafío de ensayar la música que vale la pena .
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Y no he perdido el corazón ", dijo a los estudiantes. " Nosotros cantamos las mismas media docena de himnos y otra vez, y no hay reto en todo lo que hacemos . "
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      Eso le dio a los estudiantes una idea. Se dirigió a la ministra para preguntar si el coro pudiera cantar un himno especial en su último domingo .
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      " Sí , por supuesto ", dijo el ministro, " pero siento que va a dejar nosotros. Usted apenas está comenzando a hacer una diferencia en este caso . Sin embargo , realmente creo que es necesario trabajar con un director de coro con experiencia para aprender de primera mano cómo para manejar un coro. creo que tienes en ti para ser un buen maestro de capilla " . El ministro se levantó y dijo , con un brillo en sus ojos , "No se puede pensar en el momento en que usted puede hacerlo, pero estoy seguro de que puedo. "
    </p>
    <div style="visibility: hidden; height: 0; width: 0;" id="page0015" title="pagetype_txt">
    </div>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      Estas palabras pastorales vitorearon al estudiante enormemente y casi se querían retirar su renuncia, pero él sabía que el ministro tenía razón. Necesitaba aprender observando a alguien que realmente sabía hacer el trabajo, pero cuando iba a encontrar una persona así?
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      Casi disfrutó de sus últimas semanas en la iglesia. El coro estuvo a la altura del nuevo himno y los niños comenzaron a animarse un poco, también . Dos nuevos adultos se unieron al coro de las semanas previas a la última revisión de la temporada. Estaba casi triste cuando llegó el momento de decir adiós .

      La chica con la que a menudo tenía que corregir, incluso le envió una carta de agradecimiento que ella había dibujado a sí misma. Mantuvo esa tarjeta por un largo tiempo. Se preguntó por qué era ella quien lo había enviado, en lugar de uno de los otros niños que habían tratado con más fuerza. "Tal vez lo sabré algún día", le dijo a un compañero de estudios que nos prepararon para las vacaciones. "Sólo me gustaría saber qué hacer ahora. Tengo muchas ganas de convertirse en un maestro de coro competente, pero yo simplemente no sé cómo hacerlo. Mi tocar el órgano está mejorando semana a semana, pero eso no es todo lo que estoy buscando para ".

      "He oído que el puesto de asistente de organista en una iglesia grande en la ciudad ha quedado vacante", dijo su amigo. "¿Por qué no aplicar para ello? Tienen más de 100 cantantes en sus coros. El lugar estaba abarrotado de niños y adultos, y el director del coro realmente sabe lo que hace. Hay un órgano magnífico allí también", agregó. El estudiante aplica para el cargo y fue contratado. Se cambió por completo su vida.

      El Punto de Giro
    </h2>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      El director del coro de la iglesia era un hombre alegre. Sus ojos brillaban cuando hablaba y él parecía tener mucha energía. "Bueno, ahora, jovencito", dijo mientras se sentaba al estudiante en su oficina desordenada, "¿qué quieres que ganar de ser mi ayudante?" Miró al estudiante directamente a los ojos y esperó su respuesta.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      " Bueno, señor, " respondió, " Quiero aprender cómo llegar a ser un buen director de coro . He intentado mi mano en ella , pero en realidad nada parecía funcionar. No sé por dónde empezar. "
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "He pasado toda mi vida en la música de la iglesia ", respondió el director del coro . " He cometido muchos errores. He aprendido mucho donde quiera que he estado y sigo aprendiendo . "
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      " Me encantaría saber lo que sabes ", dijo el estudiante con nostalgia. "He buscado por todas partes en busca de respuestas , pero no los he encontrado . "
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      " Los encontrarás aquí , jovencito ", dijo el director del coro alentador ", si mantiene los ojos y oídos abiertos. No hay tiempo como el presente ", dijo mientras se levantaba . " Ven y mira como me dirijo a un ensayo con algunos de mis hijos , sino que son en su mayoría estudiantes de quinto grado Empezamos en diez minutos. ".    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      " ¿Qué estás ensayando con ellos? " -preguntó el estudiante, mientras seguía al maestro de capilla de su oficina .
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      " Tenemos bastante mucho en este momento ", respondió el director de coro mientras guiaba el camino por las escaleras a la sala de prácticas . "Tenemos un par de grandes servicios que vienen este mes , así que vamos a correr a través de media docena de himnos y también miramos algo de música nueva para un concierto que estamos dando el próximo mes. "

      " Debe pasar mucho tiempo enseñando notas ", comentó el estudiante conversacional . " ¿Cómo encuentras tiempo para hacer eso ? "
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Encuentro que el tiempo , precisamente porque no enseño las notas ", dijo el director del coro . Se detuvo en seco y miró al estudiante con mucha intensidad . " Cantamos tanta música aquí , a veces tres himnos a la semana , a veces más , que cada uno tiene que ser capaz de leer la música que yo les doy , y hacerlo bien la primera vez con el mínimo de ayuda de mi parte . "
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      " ¿Cómo demonios se hace eso ? " -preguntó el estudiante, mientras trataba de obtener una posición más cómoda en la escalera.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Hay dos grandes secretos en el arte de la formación de un coro que muy poca gente sabe ", respondió el director del coro . "De estos dos grandes secretos depende toda mi llamada técnica de la formación del coro. "
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      " ¿Has aprendido los grandes secretos en la universidad? " -preguntó el estudiante .
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      " ¡No!" dijo el director del coro cuando se volvió a liderar el camino por las escaleras que quedan , "les aprendí de ver a otras personas , de mantener los ojos y los oídos abiertos , y por medio de ensayo y error. Nunca he visto escrito en ningún libro de coro formación y muy pocos de mis colegas parecen saber acerca de ellos. Sin embargo , creo que son absolutamente centrales si realmente quieres sacar lo mejor de ambos niños y adultos. a menudo me pregunto cómo me las arreglé para conseguir a través de gran parte de mi vida profesional la vida sin saber lo que sé ahora ! " el director del coro añadió con una risa irónica.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Incluso si no tuviéramos a cantar todo lo que la música cada semana, yo todavía enseñarlos a la vista - cantar porque es una habilidad que permanecerá con ellos por el resto de sus vidas. Es tan sencillo de hacer , si know how " .
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "¿Cuáles son estas dos grandes secretos ? " -preguntó el estudiante ansiosamente , porque ahora sabía que había llegado al lugar correcto y la persona correcta para aprender lo que realmente quería saber. " Es obvio que se siente muy fuertemente sobre ellos", agregó.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      " No te voy a decir ahora , " dijo el director del coro como él abrió el camino a la sala de prácticas. " Usted puede descubrir por sí mismo , porque voy a demostrar a los dos a que durante los próximos noventa minutos, entonces podemos hablar ".
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      El estudiante se sentó detrás de un banco de coro en la esquina de la sala de ensayo y vio lo que hizo el director del coro . Fue una alegría rev. Nunca había visto a nadie conducir un ensayo tan así . Los ocho niños fueron puntuales . Dos incluso llegó quince minutos antes . Todos eran muy animado y muy atento. Todos ellos trabajaron en conjunto durante una hora , con sólo un par de momentos para la relajación. El ritmo era rápido, el nivel de concentración fue de una calidad que el estudiante no había experimentado nunca , excepto en el coro de cámara de la universidad. "De alguna manera , estos niños son mejores que algunos estudiantes universitarios , " pensó. " Todos pueden leer música. ¿Cómo lo hace? "

      Después del ensayo había terminado y los dos últimos hijos íbamos, el director de coro llama al estudiante a , hablar. " ¿Has descubierto los dos grandes secretos ? " , se preguntó.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "No lo creo", respondió el estudiante , que estaba en una especie de aturdimiento a todo lo que había visto y oído.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      El maestro de capilla miró directamente a los estudiantes y dijo: "Vamos a hacer frente a sólo uno de ellos ahora, a pesar de que usted ha visto lo suficiente en los últimos noventa minutos para descubrir lo que ambos son . Déjame hacerte las preguntas correctas para que pueda dar me las respuestas correctas. Dime lo que sucedió en el comienzo de la práctica " , preguntó el director. " ¿Qué hemos hecho después de los ejercicios de calentamiento ? "
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Bueno", respondió el estudiante lentamente , de modo que pudiera tener tiempo para pensar ", que ensayó un par de himnos ".
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      " Sí , lo hice. ¿Cómo llegué a presentarme ? "
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      " Usted le dijo a los niños el número de cada himno y luego cantó un par de versos, " respondió el estudiante , en lugar seguro de su suelo.

    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      " Sí , pero ¿qué hice yo para conseguir que cantar? " insistió el director del coro .
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      " Bueno, usted jugó la melodía a través de ellos y luego cantó ", respondió el estudiante un tanto desesperada . Él realmente no podía recordar lo que el director de coro había hecho, de haber sido tan impresionado por el nivel de canto de los niños.

    <div style="visibility: hidden; height: 0; width: 0;" id="page0020" title="pagetype_txt">

      " No, eso es exactamente lo que yo no lo hice ! " dijo el director de coro con bastante fuerza .

      " Oh , oh ", pensó el estudiante . "Tengo que esforzarme más . Este hombre habla en serio ! "
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      " Mira, vamos a suponer que usted es el coro. Iremos a través de , paso a paso , exactamente lo que hice . Obtengo un himnario . Ahora bien, " dijo, cuando el estudiante estaba listo, " vamos a empezar.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Himno 460 ! " el director del coro mandó claramente .
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      " Lo siento", dijo el estudiante , " yo todavía estaba tratando de pensar en la respuesta correcta a su pregunta anterior. ¿Cuál fue el número otra vez ? "
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      Hubo un largo silencio. Pidió al director del coro : "¿Cuántas veces te he dicho el coro el número del himno ? "
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      " Oh , sólo una vez, " contestó el estudiante .
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Sí, sólo una vez! ¿Por qué? "
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      " Para asegurarse de que ellos escucharon a usted? "
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      " Sí. directores del coro tienen que repetir las instrucciones , porque los coros han entrenado a sus directores , porque ya han condicionado el director de aceptar su propio bajo nivel de concentración, de forma que todo lo que hay que decir dos o tres veces para que todos puedan oír y responder . Soy a cargo de este coro y de hacer las cosas a mi manera, no a la inversa ellos saben que yo doy una instrucción sólo una vez y por lo que el coro me escucha ; . . así su nivel de concentración es más alta que muchos cantantes en muchos otros coros que conozco "
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      " Puedo escribir eso ? " -preguntó el estudiante busca sus bolsillos un lápiz y papel. "Ese es el gran secreto ! "
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      " Sí , es posible que lo anote , pero no es el gran secreto . Muchos directores no lo saben o , si lo saben , no lo pone en práctica. El gran secreto es más importante que eso, pero nosotros ' ll llegar a ella en un momento. "
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      " ¿Cómo se llega a un coro que no se utiliza para responder inmediatamente a escuchar a usted cuando usted les dice algo una sola vez ? "
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      " Usted en primer lugar, llamar su atención. Puede que tenga que hacer esto de la manera antigua, mediante la repetición de la llamada para pedir silencio. Entonces usted les dice que a partir de ahora, cuando usted les dice algo que va a hacer una sola vez. ¿Por qué tengo esta expectativa ? "
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">

    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      " Ahora llegamos a la gran secreto", dijo el director del coro . "¿Qué pasó cuando los niños encuentran el himno ? "
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      El estudiante pensó furiosamente. " Usted jugó la primera nota de ellos y luego se cantó el primer verso . "
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Eso es un poco mejor, pero aún así han perdido todo el sentido de lo que estaba haciendo . Mira, " dijo más amablemente , "nosotros seguiremos imaginando que son el coro y que se haya instalado el himno. ¿Qué Qué he dicho a ellos? "
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      " Canten la primera nota , " respondió el estudiante, cuando él comenzó a entender lo que el maestro de coro había estado haciendo.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "¡Sí! Absolutamente cierto . ¿Qué no debo hacer? "
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Usted no tocar la primera nota para ellos. Tuvieron que imaginar por sí mismos. ¿Por qué has hecho eso ? Seguramente , sería mucho más rápido que ha jugado la nota para ellos que para pasar unos valiosos segundos pidiendo una tenga en cuenta que podría haber cantado mal " .
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      " Sí , hubiera sido más rápido , pero no habría sido mejor ! " respondió el maestro de coro . "Ahí es donde muchos directores de coro van mal. Ellos piensan que el corto plazo, la solución rápida es la mejor . Ya no trabajo para el corto plazo , estoy trabajando para el largo plazo. Estoy trabajando de manera que mis hijos , por el tiempo que he estado en mi coro por tres años, pueden recoger una copia del Mesías de Handel y cantar cualquier coro casi justo a primera vista. Piensa lo que un ahorro de tiempo que es!

    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Así que, ¿por qué crees que les pedí a cantar la nota, en lugar de escuchar a mí jugar para ellos? " preguntó el director del coro . " ¿Qué tienen que ver con el fin de hacer un intento de cantar la primera nota? "
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Tenían que mirar a la música! " respondió el estudiante con impaciencia .
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "¡Sí! Tenían que mirar a la música de forma inteligente , la comprensión de lo que significaba. Eso viene de la enseñanza cuidadosa de mi parte. Utilizar todos los medios posibles para obtener los cantantes a mirar las notas de forma inteligente . Será tiempo muy bien invertido. Se paga enormes dividendos. Por cierto ", agregó , " qué importaba si ellos cantaron el derecho nota o malo? "
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      Supongo que sería mejor haber hecho bien " .
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      " Sí , pero incluso si se habían equivocado , que significaba que tenían que pensar . La mayoría de los directores de coro no todo el pensamiento de sus cantantes y sus cantantes se les deja! Estimular a los cantantes a pensar creativamente en todo momento. "
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      " Por lo tanto, son los dos grandes secretos? " -preguntó el estudiante .
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      " No", respondió el director del coro , " pero son los secretos que usted necesita saber y poner en práctica. "
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      " Déjame escribir hacia abajo ", dijo el estudiante.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-l-1-v1">
      • Utilizar todos los medios para conseguir los cantantes a mirar las notas de forma inteligente .
    </p>
    <p class="cl-l-1-v1">
      • Estimular a los cantantes a pensar creativamente en todo momento.

    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      " Ahora sí que me siento que estamos a punto de llegar al gran secreto ", sonrió el director del coro . " ¿Qué he hecho después de que los niños habían intentado cantar la primera nota? "
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      " Usted tocó la primera nota para ellos y estaban muy cerca. "
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      " Sí , ¿qué más? "
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      " Usted jugó la primera nota para ellos y estaban muy cerca. "
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      " Usted está casi justo . Jugué la primera nota, y luego jugué el primer acorde . ¿Por qué? "
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      Hubo un silencio . El director de coro continuó . " No son muchos los directores de coro se dan cuenta de que acaba de dar una nota no es útil. Singers necesitan oír la tonalidad en la que están cantando . Las necesidades clave que se establezcan en sus mentes antes de empezar a cantar . Por ejemplo , la reproducción de un G y luego jugar el acorde de Mi bemol mayor da un mensaje completamente diferente de jugar G y entonces el acorde de Do mayor . por lo tanto , los niños están listos para cantar la primera estrofa del himno .

      " ¿Qué no hice? " -preguntó el director de coro .
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      " Tú no tocar la melodía para ellos. Tenían que mirar las notas y el trabajo por sí mismos ", respondió el estudiante triunfalmente .
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "¡Sí! Pero, por supuesto , esto viene sólo después de que han estado trabajando conmigo durante un par de semanas . ¿Cómo me estructuro el resto de la práctica? " -preguntó el maestro de coro .
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      " Lo has hecho exactamente el mismo para cada pieza musical. Primero, usted les dijo una sola vez lo que era la siguiente pieza , y lo encontró rápidamente. En segundo lugar, les pedimos a cantar la primera nota. En tercer lugar, a continuación, jugado a la primera nota y el primer acorde . Cuarto, usted les dijo a empezar a cantar sin haber jugado la melodía a ellos en absoluto. y en quinto lugar , me di cuenta de que ha utilizado muy poco acompañamiento una vez que se inició a cantar. ¿No les ayuda mucho ! "
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Correcto , joven ! " dijo el director del coro emocionado. "Puedo ver que nos vamos a llevar muy bien. El gran secreto es que el conjunto de mi práctica se orienta al solfeo .
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      " Ya ves ", prosiguió, " no sirve de nada en absoluto enseñar a los niños a la vista - cantar si no se va a permitir el ejercicio de sus competencias , para que puedan estar mejor y mejor con cada práctica . Algunos coro bastante iluminado práctica directores durante cinco minutos vista de canto . Eso no es bueno ! tienen que practicar la vista - cantando todo el tiempo. de esta manera los niños tienen que pensar por sí mismos . ellos realmente se involucran con lo que están haciendo . los niños no van a la dormir durante mis prácticas " , dijo con firmeza el director del coro .
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Realmente creo que estoy empezando a ver cómo tener éxito en la formación del coro, " dijo el estudiante. "Los niños deben hacer la forma de pensar . Están haciendo el canto y no el director del coro . "

      Al día siguiente, el estudiante estaba de nuevo sentado en la oficina desordenada del maestro de coro hablando de todo lo que había visto y oído la noche anterior. " Casi no dormí en toda la noche . Estaba tan herida por todo lo que pasó ayer. Era tan emocionante ! "
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "" Sí , a menudo me siento así también", respondió el director del coro . " Para hacer bien este trabajo , usted tiene que darse por entero a ella en todo momento . Cuando las cosas van bien , comparto el entusiasmo de los niños, y cuando van mal, me siento que quiero dar para arriba! "
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      " Hacer las cosas a veces salen mal para usted ? " -preguntó el estudiante incrédulo.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      " Oh , si.  No se puede ganar todo el tiempo. Pero en un período de meses y años, que construir una estructura de apoyo de todos los que participan en el coro Esto viene no sólo a través de los cantantes , pero también a sus familias . es esta estructura que se levanta cuando las cosas parecen ir mal . me paso tanta energía animando a otros que cuando vienen malos momentos , los miembros y sus familias me animan " .

      " Pero vamos a hablar más sobre el gran secreto que viste en la acción de ayer", continuó el director del coro . "Hay tantos directores de coro no parecen hacer llegar el mensaje sobre el engranaje del conjunto de sus prácticas de canto a primera vista . Para mí , lo que permite a los niños a leer música es uno de los dones más preciosos y duraderos que puede ofrecerles. Sin ella, son musicalmente ciego. ellos tienen que confiar en la gente al lado de ellos para guiarlos a través de una pieza musical. Muchos cantantes se quedan como ese derecho a través de la edad adulta. Usted no lo hace, ya que algunas personas parecen pensar , aprender a cantar - vista sólo a través de la pertenencia a un buen coro.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Por ejemplo, hace poco conocí a un abogado que era , hace unos años , niño de la cabeza de lo que es considerado como uno de los mejores coros de hombres y niños en este país. Ese muchacho cantó la música de la iglesia más ambicioso casi todos los días durante cuatro años . cuando lo conocí , él me dijo que él se había unido recientemente el coro de su iglesia local cuando cantaron el " Aleluya " del Mesías. él me dijo que se encontró cantando la parte de agudos una octava más baja porque no podía leer música. podrías haberme derribado con una pluma.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Había un hombre inteligente que habían estado expuestos a todo lo que es mejor en la música de la iglesia , y sin embargo, es musicalmente ciego. Es trágico . Hay tantas gente como esa , no sólo en este país sino también en todo el mundo, que han dado tres o cuatro de sus años de formación a cantar en coros de niños y, sin embargo , que salir de ella sin nada , excepto unos pocos recuerdos felices de lo divertido que solía ser. Por otro lado , muchos de mis niños del coro más tarde descubren que son líderes en sus coros escolares y universitarios , ya que pueden cantar las notas correctas de inmediato " .
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Dime exactamente cómo estructurar sus prácticas para sightsinging ", dijo el estudiante que no había sido capaz de conseguir una palabra en varios minutos .
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      " Usted vio exactamente cómo lo hice ", respondió el director del coro . "Cada nota, cada frase y cada página los cantantes tienen que trabajar por sí mismos. ¿Por qué no toco la línea de la melodía junto con ellos ? " -preguntó de repente.

    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      " Pero seguramente esto toma mucho más tiempo que simplemente tocar la nota para ellos en el piano ? " respondió el estudiante .    
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Por supuesto que no ", exclamó el director del coro , dando un puñetazo sobre la mesa. "Te dije que de eso ayer, ¿no te acuerdas ? "
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      El estudiante , sorprendido por esta explosión repentina , se dio cuenta de que tendría que esforzarse más porque estaba tratando con un hombre que tenía tan altos estándares y creencias fuertes . Este maestro de coro espera que sus estudiantes a recordar lo que habían aprendido. " Oh , sí , lo siento ! Usted dijo que está trabajando para el bien a largo plazo de los niños y esto lleva su tiempo . "
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      " Eso está mejor ", dijo el director del coro de relax en su silla . "Hay tantos directores de coro trabajan para el objetivo a corto plazo de conseguir las notas a la derecha inmediatamente - lo que significa jugar con ellos a sus hijos , lo que significa enseñarles por ... memoria ! ¡Qué palabra tan horrible que es! " Hubo un silencio .
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Los niños que se enseñan sólo por rutina se les enseña a ser completamente dependiente del director del coro . Cuando el director del coro es allí, pueden cantar la música. Cuando el director del coro no está allí , no pueden cantar la música nunca más. Es muy triste ! " -exclamó, golpeando la mesa con el puño de nuevo. "Esos directores se han hecho indispensables para sus cantantes .

    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      ""Mi credo es hacerme prescindible. Los niños hacen el canto , yo no . Después que los niños han estado conmigo durante un año o dos, que sé todas las técnicas de entrenamiento de coro que yo hago . Los conocen tan bien que no tengo que decirles lo que deben hacer. les pregunto lo que deben hacer y , nueve de cada diez veces , me dan la respuesta correcta y hacen. es tan simple " . Se levantó de su silla y golpeó un archivador para enfatizar sus fuertes sentimientos.    
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      Cuando se hubo sentado de nuevo , el estudiante se atrevió a preguntar: " Entonces , ¿podrías recordarme cómo estructurar las prácticas de canto a primera vista ? "
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Sí", el director del coro se rió, " usted ha sido muy paciente Hagamos una lista concisa . :

      " 1 . Juega un ligero acompañamiento . Jugando en voz alta , ya que muchos directores de coro no , no permite a los cantantes para escucharse a sí mismos . Menudo juego individual por lo que los cantantes pueden oírse a sí mismos con facilidad en los descansos entre las notas - como esta. "

        "Podría ser", dijo el director del coro suavemente . "Eso sin duda ayuda . Pero era algo que me dijiste ayer sobre mi actitud ante toda esta situación . "

    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
        " Oh , sí ! Dije que te sientes fuertemente sobre lo que está haciendo . "

"Afecta a su preparación para las prácticas , su puntualidad en las prácticas , el cuidado pastoral de los niños y adultos de todo. Asegura que no escatimará esfuerzos para garantizar que todos los niños que se une a su coro será capaz de leer música en el menor tiempo posible. se hace la vida mucho más fácil.

      "Los niños necesitan ser motivados para aprender", continuó el director del coro . "Ellos sólo van a aprender de ti lo que realmente quiere enseñarles. Usted debe creer en el valor de lo que está enseñando . Si realmente quieres enseñar a los niños a la vista - cantar , debe tener una pasión por ella .
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      " ¿Cuántas personas conoces que están en dietas perpetuas ? " el director del coro preguntó inesperadamente. Sin esperar una respuesta , continuó. " La razón por la que están en dietas es porque no son capaces de alterar sus hábitos alimenticios. Aquellas personas que alteran sus hábitos alimenticios no tienen problemas con su peso. Ellos han entrado en un nuevo modo de vivir. Es exactamente lo mismo con los niños de enseñanza para vista -sing ", continuó el director del coro .

    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      " Si usted va a comenzar a enseñar a los niños a la vista - cantar en la manera en que yo te mostraré , debe modificar la forma en que llevas tus prácticas del coro . Prácticas de liderazgo en el camino viejo (cuando usted les dio las notas correctas para cantar y didn 't les estimulan a pensar ) hará toda su enseñanza de la decadencia vista de canto . no va a ser usado en la situación para la que fue diseñada.

    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      The next afternoon, the student and the choirmaster were 
      standing by the piano in the large, airy practice room. The sun 
      shone through the tall windows and lit up the music stands that 
      were arranged on either side of the piano. Row after row of music 
      boxes neatly lined the walls. Behind the piano was a large chalkboard with a supply of colored chalks.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "This is a marvelous choir room," commented the student.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Yes, we're very fortunate to have one of the finest practice 
      facilities in this country," answered the choirmaster. "I had these 
      music stands made especially for this room. The children and the 
      adults have to stand for all practices and they love it. They know 
      that we mean business when we come in here. It helps their concentration wonderfully.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "We had the choirmaster of the most famous English men and 
      boys' choir visit us recently. He said he wished he could have such 
      a practice room! When you get your own church, really work to 
      make your practice room comfortable, well-lit with plenty of ventilation, and geared to hard work, and with music filed neatly and 
      readily available," he added. "You see that all singers have their 
      own cubbies with next month's music ready to use. Our librarian is 
      a treasure. I couldn't run the choirs without him.

      "It is to this room that singers come week after week from 
      their comfortable homes. Let it be welcoming. Let it be warm in 
      winter and cool in summer. Let it be tidy. Let it be efficient. The 
      importance of having a really good choir room and maintaining it 
      well cannot be over stressed.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Let's get back to the coming rehearsal. When I was leaving 
      my office yesterday I gave you a hint about the second wheel," 
      said the choirmaster. "How many children did I say were coming 
      to see me this afternoon?"
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Four," answered the student quickly.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Well done!" exclaimed the choirmaster, smiling. "You listen 
      attentively and so you will do very well here." The student glowed 
      quietly under the choirmaster's approval. "It's almost impossible to 
      teach children to sight-sing really well in a large group. Do you 
      know why?"
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "I suppose it's difficult to supervise everyone's progress," ventured the student hesitantly.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Yes, but it's much more than that. Children are wonderful 
      imitators," explained the choirmaster. "It takes only one child in a 
      group who knows what he or she is doing for everyone else to follow him or her. The others follow so quickly they don't even realize it. They believe they are doing the thinking, when actually, it's 
      someone else. It's even worse than that, for there's someone else 
      who doesn't realize that the children are following a strong leader. 
      Who can that be?"
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "The choir director!" responded the student quickly.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Yes indeed! Some choir directors think all their singers can 
      read music, not realizing that most are following only one or two 
      people in the group who are doing all the leading for the choir. 
      When those one or two are absent, the whole thing collapses. If 
      you have children in small groups, they cannot hide behind anyone 
      else. They have to do all the thinking for themselves!"
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "I see," said the student. "The matter of learning to sight-sing 
      is the ability to think creatively-to work out for yourself what the 
      next note sounds like and then sing it."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "My word!" said the choirmaster, "that was very perceptive of 
      you."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      The student tried to keep an impassive face, for he had surprised even himself by what he had just said. Perhaps the choir master's active thinking had inspired him.
    </p>
    <div style="visibility: hidden; height: 0; width: 0;" id="page0035" title="pagetype_txt">
    </div>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Write down the second wheel," commanded the choirmaster.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      The student took out his notebook and wrote:
    </p>
    <p class="cl-i-h1-c-v1">
      Wheel 2 
      Work in small groups.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      After the student finished writing, the choirmaster said, "I 
      should tell you that I know one school music teacher who claims 
      that she can teach sight-singing in large groups. She came to some 
      of my practices to see what I was doing. She heard me say that 
      teaching sight-singing doesn't work in big groups. However, two 
      months later she told me she tried my methods and found they did 
      work in the classroom. In fact, she said her most productive 
      singing classes are half-hour sessions twice a week when all the 
      children practice nothing but sight-singing. She told me the children love it.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "But for me," added the choirmaster, "it doesn't work like 
      that. It takes me twice as long to train two children as it does to 
      train one child. It takes twice as long to train four as it does two, 
      and so on. The smaller the group, the more efficient will be your 
      teaching. At least, that's what I've found to be true in my experience."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Then why are you seeing four children this afternoon instead 
      of just one?" asked the student.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Because these children want to join the choir now," 
      answered the choirmaster. "There are only so many hours in the 
      day when they can come and when I can fit them in. It doesn't 
      matter if it takes two months instead of one month to teach them 
      how to sight-sing. Their vocal production will be improving all the 
      time. Further, they will be getting a feel of what it's like to become 
      a member of a closely knit team. The extra time will be well spent. 
      If I ask three of them to wait for a month or so until I have taught 
      one child, what are the chances of all three children returning to 
      me?"
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Pretty slim, I should think," responded the student.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Yes! They will have filled their time with other activities and 
      I'll have lost them. We are in a highly competitive field here," the 
      choirmaster added. "Children have so many demands on their time these days that I have to catch them while they're still willing 
      to be caught!"
    </p>
    <div style="visibility: hidden; height: 0; width: 0;" id="page0036" title="pagetype_txt">
    </div>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Oh!" exclaimed the student, "I thought you were selective 
      when you audition children for your choirs."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Good heavens, no!" answered the choirmaster. "I take almost 
      anyone I can get. My job is to turn unpromising children into educated musicians. Where do you think these grey hairs came from?" 
      he asked with a smile, pulling his tangled locks.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "I thought you said that choir training was simple."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      It is," answered the choirmaster. "The road is very clear for 
      those who know where it is, but you have to walk it energetically 
      and full of care for the singers; and that takes a lot out of you. Are 
      you prepared to spend yourself in that way for the rest of your 
      life?"
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "I hadn't thought of it like that," answered the student. "When 
      I tried training a choir for six months, it absolutely wore me out 
      with worry."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      That was because you weren't doing it right," said the choirmaster. "Choir training will absolutely wear you out, but the worries will be far outweighed by the rewards and thrills that will come 
      your way at every practice as you watch the children grow in every 
      possible good way. Further, they will love you for it. You are giving them something they can get nowhere else. They know it and 
      their parents know it. What you spend on them, in care and time, 
      you and they will have forever; and that is something money cannot buy."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Wow!" exclaimed the student. "Let's do it, then."

      "That's easy! You teach them things they can achieve."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Right! It is vitally important that the children are able to do 
      what you ask them to do. They must succeed in carrying out every 
      challenge you give."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "How do you manage that?"
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "You tell me!" said the choirmaster unexpectedly, looking the 
      student squarely in the face.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Whoops," thought the student, "I was expecting him to do 
      my thinking for me. How easy it is to slip into that mode of not 
      thinking!" There was a silence as the student thought furiously for 
      several seconds, but no answer came to mind.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Should you teach them in giant leaps or small steps?" the 
      choirmaster asked, breaking the silence.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Oh, small steps," answered the student gratefully.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Yes," said the choirmaster. "How many small steps should you teach at one time?"

    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Perhaps two or three," ventured the student, not sure of his 
      ground.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Try again."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "One or two?"
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "You're getting warmer," said the choirmaster patiently.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "One?"
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "One indeed! You must realize that you are taking your children on a road they don't know and where they are more likely to 
      be wrong than right. If they are to enjoy this learning experience 
      with you, they need to know they will almost certainly get it right 
      with your help, rather than wrong."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "I see! I know when I've given a right answer to you, I feel 
      good about it."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Why is that?" inquired the choirmaster.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "People like to be right. It does things to their egos."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Yes, but there's more to it than that. Who else felt good 
      when you gave a right answer?"
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Well, you did, I suppose," said the student.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "`Suppose' nothing! Didn't you realize that I felt genuine pleasure when you gave me a right answer?" The choirmaster 
      thumped the top of the piano with his fist.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Oh, yes! You smiled when I got it right. I remember now," 
      said the student, realizing the choirmaster felt strongly about this, 
      too.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "That's better! A choirmaster has to feel genuine pleasure 
      when his children succeed. What else goes with this?"
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "The choirmaster has to express that pleasure so that the children know it. It really motivates them to try to succeed because 
      they want to please their director," answered the student.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Right! How does one ensure a whole stream of right 
      answers?" pressed the choirmaster.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Teach just one thing at a time so the singer will get it thoroughly right and be successful," answered the student.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Yes, nothing succeeds like success. Once the children understand that being with you enables them to succeed, then you're on 
      a roll. Write that down."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      The student thought for a while, and then wrote:

      "You'd be surprised how many choir directors and teachers 
      don't do that," said the choirmaster. "For example, how many 
      things are involved in singing a verse of a hymn correctly?"
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1 cl-pd-v1_secondary_1_2">
      The student thought for a while and said, "The notes must be

      "The pitch and the rhythm," answered the student, aware he 
      hadn't really been thinking hard enough. "I guess the children 
      must be concentrating on three things to sing a verse of a hymn 
      correctly. "
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1 cl-pd-v1_secondary_1_2">
      "What about tuning and tone, and breathing and posture, and 
      clear enunciation, and shape of the mouth, and a relaxed jaw, and 
      on and on?"
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1 cl-pd-v1_secondary_1_2">
      "Oh," the student sighed. There was a pause.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1 cl-pd-v1_secondary_1_2">
      "Just think how many things are involved in breathing correctly-let alone doing the singing in conjunction with breathing. The 
      list is almost endless."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1 cl-pd-v1_secondary_1_2">
      "I hadn't realized that singing one verse of a hymn involved so 
      many different skills," said the student
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1 cl-pd-v1_secondary_1_2">
      "Few choir directors do. That's why many children are not 
      successful in taking these techniques into their innermost being. 
      They are presented with far too many things to think about at one 
      time. They quickly give up and settle for what they can get away 
      with; and their choir directors think that's all their singers can do. 
      They are wrong. Children can achieve far more than most choir 
      directors have ever dreamed!" He thumped the piano again several times.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1 cl-pd-v1_secondary_1_2">
      "That's putting it rather strongly, isn't it?" said the student.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1 cl-pd-v1_secondary_1_2">
      "Maybe it is, but if you don't feel strongly about what you are 
      doing, you won't achieve anything. I feel strongly about it, very 
      strongly, and my children feel strongly, too, otherwise they

      The sound of children playing outside filtered through an open 
      window. "We must get on," said the choirmaster, "the children will 
      be coming in very soon.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Wheel 4 is not so obvious, but it is absolutely essential to the 
      success of teaching children sight-singing. I'll get you to tell me 
      what it is," he said, giving the student another of his direct looks.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "He's challenging me again," thought the student. "I need to 
      be on my toes!"
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      The choirmaster continued, "What's involved in reading 
      music? Or, putting it another way, there are two parts to music; 
      there's the theoretical, and what else?"
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "The practical," responded the student.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "And how do they relate to the reading of music?"
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      There was a pause as the student thought. "The printed page 
      is the theoretical part, and the singing of the notes is the practical."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Absolutely right!" beamed the choirmaster, showing that he 
      was genuinely pleased with his pupil. "it is vital that whenever you 
      ask the children to sing something, they must also see it written 
      down-even if it's only a single note you are using to help them 
      produce their voices correctly. Let them see their warm-up exercis es written on the chalkboard. By the way, always have a chalkboard in your practice room. I can't do without mine. The children 
      must see what they sing," the choirmaster continued. "What follows?"

    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "They must sing what they see," said the student triumphantly.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Right! Every theoretical point must be made practical, and 
      made practical immediately. Theory and practice. It's no use 
      spending five minutes learning the names of the notes on the 
      spaces, that's just dry theory. All theory, by definition, is dry, especially for children. What must they do once they know where G 
      is?"
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "They have to sing G! Every theoretical point must be made 
      immediately practical," answered the student.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      The choirmaster interrupted, "And every practical point must 
      be made theoretical. By the way, what did I do wrong just now in 
      my enthusiasm?" he asked the student.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "You took away from me what I was just about to say," 
      answered the student, hesitantly.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Yes! I apologize for that. That's something that so many 
      choir directors do, assuming they are enlightened enough to teach 
      through asking questions. Often, they do not allow the child 
      enough time to answer the question fully. You need to watch out 
      for that. It's such an easy trap to fall into," he said with a wry 
      smile.

      The chimes of the church clock striking the hour filled the 
      practice room. "We won't have time to discuss Wheel 5," said the 
      choirmaster. "It's time for the practice to begin."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "There are five wheels?" asked the student. "I thought cars 
      had only four wheels!"

      "You've missed the most important one," answered the choirmaster, "but we'll have to go into that another time. It's vital to be

      open and four boys rushed in, talking at the tops of their voices.

    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      The choirmaster sat quietly and watched as the boys 
      approached the piano. The student noticed that the choirmaster 
      had his direct-look expression. He wondered how the choirmaster 
      would deal with the noisy boys.They reminded him of some of the 
      children he had directed. "This I must see," he thought.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      The children continued chattering as they gathered around the 
      grand piano. The choirmaster simply folded his arms, leaned on 
      the piano, and looked intently at them.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      After fifteen seconds the children noticed that they were being 
      looked at rather directly, and the chattering began to die down. 
      After another few seconds, it stopped entirely and there was 
      silence.

      Five more seconds went by. "It seems more like five minutes," 
      thought the student, as the children and choirmaster looked at 
      each other across the piano. "I wonder what he's going to say 
      first? He'll blast them, I know!"
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "I'm pleased with you," said the choirmaster, most unexpectedly. "Why am I pleased with you?" One of the boys put up his 
      hand. "Yes, Luke?"
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Because we came in on time," the boy answered.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Yes! Did we agree last week that being on time would be a 
      good thing to do?"
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Yes, we did," murmured the boys, not quite sure what to 
      make of the situation.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Yes, we did indeed! What else did we agree on last weekabout how the practice should begin?"
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      There was a pause and another boy spoke, "Because we have 
      all come a long way for practice, we agreed that it would be a 
      good idea if we made the most of our time here."

      "Right again! Were you ready when you came in here, Chris?"
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "No, we were talking," answered Chris sheepishly.

    <p class="cl-pd-v1">

      "Okay. I think you have the message. I'm here to help you

      "When I've finished speaking, I want you to go out of the

      "Yes," said the choirmaster, "that's Wheel 5-the steering 
      wheel. The children must learn quickly to respond to what I say. They must realize that I mean everything I tell them. Children need 
      boundaries within which they can work. If they learn that you 
      don't really mean what you say, they won't know where they are, 
      and they'll call the shots. From the children's very first practice on, 
      they need to know that the boundaries are there to help them 
      achieve the great things that I have in store for them.

      Two days later, after observing a sight-singing session of girls, 
      the student was again in the choirmaster's untidy office. A pile of 
      papers had been cleared from one of the chairs and the student 
      was sitting with pencil and notebook in his hands.

    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Well, what did you think of these two sight-singing sessions

      yesterday?" asked the choirmaster leaning back in his chair.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "May I ask you a question first? When the noisy boys came in, 
      why didn't you tell them to be quiet immediately? Isn't that what 
      you wanted?"
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "That's a very good question. Let me ask you one. What did I 
      say to the boys as soon as they were quiet enough to hear me?"
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "You told them that you were pleased with them because they 
      were punctual."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Right. You see, I needed to get them into the frame of mind 
      so that they would really hear what I had to say about their noisy 
      behavior. If I had blasted them right away, they would have turned 
      sullen and treated me like an unhelpful taskmaster. Then the practice would have begun badly. That would have set up a negative 
      situation. I had to turn the situation around into a positive onepositive for them and positive for me.

      "The easiest way to do that was to say something appreciative, which they knew to be true. That got them listening to me. 
      Once I had their attention, then I could address the other matter. 
      By the way," he added, "did I tell them about the noisy behavior or 
      did they tell me?"

    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "They told you," the student responded. Then his eyes lit up. 
      "Oh, I see. When they tell you, they have ownership of the need 
      to behave well. They wouldn't do it just because you said so, but 
      they will do it because they said so!"
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Yes, you really are very perceptive, young man. Not many 
      people would have spotted that, but you did. You have the makings of an alert teacher."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Let me write down those two helpful hints," said the student 
      gratefully, opening his notebook:
    </p>
    <p class="cl-l-1-v1">
      • An appreciative remark enables children to 
      hear what you say.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-l-1-v1">
      • Get them to tell you what you really want to 
      tell them. Then they're more likely to do it.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Much of what we're discussing applies not only to children," 
      commented the choirmaster. "It applies equally well to adults. If 
      you have something difficult to say to an adult, get his or her attention by saying something positive first, then he or she will hear you 
      more easily.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Now, tell me what you thought of those two practices," said 
      the choirmaster.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Well, you achieved much more with the boys than you did 
      with the girls," answered the student. "Why was that?"
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "You can answer the question yourself," said the choirmaster, 
      giving him a direct look.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      The student thought, "He's challenging me again." After a few 
      seconds he said, "It was not because the boys were more talented 
      than the girls or had better voices."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Right. In fact, some of the girls were more intelligent than the 
      boys and were much more willing to concentrate for long periods. 
      It must have been something else. Look at the five wheels again 
      and tell me which one applies here."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      The student thought again for a moment and then exclaimed, 
      "Of course! It was because you had eight girls and only four boys. 
      You were able to achieve only half as much with the girls as you did the boys. It's obvious."
    </p>
    <div style="visibility: hidden; height: 0; width: 0;" id="page0048" title="pagetype_txt">
    </div>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Everything I tell you is obvious," answered the choirmaster, 
      at least, it's obvious to me. The trouble is that very few people 
      are able to see the obvious, even when it's right in front of them."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Does it matter if one group gets on faster than another?" 
      asked the student.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Not in the least," said the choirmaster. "The important thing 
      is that each group and each child in that group progresses at the 
      pace that is right for them. There are no time constraints here. 
      What matters is that each step in the learning process is covered 
      thoroughly and understood completely by each child. They will all 
      be able to read music within a short time and will get better at it 
      the longer they are in the choir. Why is that?"
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Is it because you keep on encouraging them to sight-sing 
      throughout their choir careers?"
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Yes, but how do I encourage them? We discussed this major 
      point when we first met."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Oh, yes. You lead every choir practice so that sight-singing is 
      the major focus. You never play the notes for them. The singers 
      have to work them out for themselves. The children do all the 
      thinking in your practices."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Absolutely right! Learning to sight-sing is a skill that can get 
      better and better. Further, it will remain with them for the rest of 
      their lives just like reading words on a page."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      The student thought a while, "You said that there was a learning process. Could you tell me exactly what that process is?"
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "No," said the choirmaster, "it will be much better if ..." he 
      waited for the student to finish the sentence.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "It will be much better if I tell you what the process is," finished the student. "How do I do that?"
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "I'm going to ask you the right questions. The best method of 
      teaching is for the teacher to ask the right question so the students 
      can find the right answer for themselves-they own the answer. 
      You'd better write that down."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      The student opened his notebook and wrote:
    </p>
    <p class="cl-l-1-v1">
      • Teach by asking the right questions.

      FT'S BEGIN," SAID THE CHOIRMASTER. "There are twelve 
      steps you must take to enable a child, or anyone else for 
      that matter, to be able to read music surely and easily. 
      I've been working at this system all my life and I've proved over 
      and over again that it really works. Other choir directors who have 
      tried it say that it works for them, too." He paused and looked at 
      the student who was waiting to be impressed by the revelation of 
      profound secrets discovered over a lifetime.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "These twelve steps are not difficult or obscure," said the 
      choirmaster, reading the student's thoughts. "They are simplicity 
      itself. Anyone can work out what they are, given a little clear, 
      practical thought." He smiled and said, "Let's begin with you 
      telling me the first step."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      The choirmaster leaned forward in his chair, fixed the student 
      with his direct gaze, and asked, "What is the absolute basic minimum skill children have to acquire at the very beginning of their 
      choir careers to enable them to begin to read music?"
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      After a pause, the student said, "The children must be able to 
      sing the first note correctly."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Well done! Until a child can pitch one note accurately, there's 
      no point in asking him or her to sing a scale, much less attempt to sight-sing a song. Now, most of the children you heard during the 
      past few days could pitch notes pretty well, but there was one in 
      each group who could not. How did I deal with that situation?"
    </p>
    <div style="visibility: hidden; height: 0; width: 0;" id="page0050" title="pagetype_txt">
    </div>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "You tried several approaches. You asked the boy to try 
      again. If that didn't work, you asked his neighbor to sing the note. 
      I saw that this worked well in one case, but not the other. For the 
      girl with the real problem, who sang under the given note, you 
      changed your note to match the note she sang."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Yes. A child often finds it hard to pitch a tone from a note 
      played on the piano, but finds it easier when the note is sung by 
      someone else. This is where women choir directors have the 
      advantage over men; they can sing in the right register for children," said the choirmaster.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      The student continued, "With the girl, once you agreed on the 
      same pitch, you gradually raised the notes you asked her to sing, 
      going up the scale, one note at a time. That worked for the first 
      two or three notes, but then she got stuck."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Yes, I had to alter my program quickly for that child. I saw 
      that she couldn't achieve everything I'd originally planned for her. I 
      set a special goal for her. I asked her to sing just those two or 
      three notes correctly, and then left it. Did you notice I showed that 
      I was particularly pleased with what she had achieved during that 
      minute?"
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Yes, I did," responded the student. "She achieved relatively 
      more than the other children because she'd started further back 
      than they had."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "The choirmaster's attitude has to be wholly positive in this 
      process. Children have to realize you are pleased with them 
      because they're trying hard, not because they happen to get things 
      right. A little achievement is all I'm seeking-coupled with total 
      concentration for the whole of the practice. Each child goes at his 
      or her own pace." The choirmaster paused for a moment, and 
      then asked, "Now, why did I spend only a minute with that girl?"
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Because the other children's attention might begin to wander," said the student.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Yes! It's very important to mix what you are doing with the 
      children. Have them sing briefly by themselves, have them sing in 
      small groups, and then have them sing all together. If you are constantly changing pace, color, and demands, the children will be kept on their mental toes. Have them sing. Have them answer 
      questions. Have them stand. Have them sit. Have them face this 
      way and then that way.
    </p>
    <div style="visibility: hidden; height: 0; width: 0;" id="page0051" title="pagetype_txt">
    </div>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "You noticed how I moved around. I didn't stay sitting at the 
      piano as so many choir directors do. I walked around the children. 
      I had the children stand by me and then stand on the far side of 
      the piano. I asked them to listen to the other children and tell me 
      how they did. At no time was there any doubt that I expected 
      every child to be involved for the whole forty-five minutes. Even 
      when I was dealing with the child who had pitch problems, I 
      involved the other children, too. How did I do that?"
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "You asked one of them to sing the note the other child found 
      difficult," answered the student. "You said, `Who can sing this note 
      for me?' Several of the children put up their hands and you asked 
      one of them to sing it."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Yes, then I asked the children to raise their hands when the 
      girl sang the note right. That's positive input. She wanted to earn 
      the respect of her peers. All children do, so I enabled this to happen. Then she had her turn at putting up her hand when the other 
      children sang. We were all in it together."
    </p>
    <h4 class="cl-h1-l-v1">
      Step 1A: Learning about pulse
    </h4>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      The choirmaster paused for a minute. "There's so much to say 
      about choir training techniques, but this is not the time. We can 
      discuss those later. Let's continue with Step 1 in the sight-singing 
      process."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Singing one note," said the student.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Singing one note, yes; but there were three other things I did 
      with the children while getting them to sing one note correctly. 
      What were they? By the way, you noticed I asked them to sing 
      middle G for me, not middle C. We'll talk about that later."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "You asked them to sing the note for four counts."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "That's right. It's very important to give the children an exact 
      aim. If they were asked to sing only one note, that would be open 
      ended. When they are asked to sing the note while you count four, 
      they know exactly what they have to do."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      The student said, "I noticed that you counted four on your fingers, giving them something to look at. You showed them that 
      they had to stop singing at the count of five when you counted your thumb as five."
    </p>
    <div style="visibility: hidden; height: 0; width: 0;" id="page0052" title="pagetype_txt">
    </div>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Did you notice if the children got it nearly right or exactly 
      right?" asked the choirmaster.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Some of them got it exactly right the first time, but others 
      had to give it more than one go," observed the student. "You put 
      one of your five wheels into operation."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Well done! The children must be able to do what you ask 
      them to do, and you stay with it until they do." The choirmaster 
      got up from his office chair and strode around the room, carefully 
      avoiding a pile of papers on the floor. "I want them to get it right 
      so much that I almost will them to do it right. I know they can and 
      I can picture them doing it right so strongly that they eventually do 
      get it right. 
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      He sat down again, quivering slightly. "That's Wheel 1," he 
      added. "You must have a passion for this business, otherwise it 
      won't work." He smiled at the student who responded with a grin.
    </p>
    <h4 class="cl-h1-l-v1">
      Step 1B: Learning about the stave
    </h4>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "The second thing you did in the first practice was to write the 
      note G on the stave on the chalkboard. That was the note you 
      asked them to sing. That was Wheel 4: Every theoretical point 
      must be made practical and vice versa."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Did I tell them that it was the note G I wrote on the chalkboard?" asked the choirmaster.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "No, you asked them; you didn't tell them. As you began to 
      write the five lines of a stave on the chalkboard, you asked them 
      how many lines it takes to write music. They quickly responded by 
      saying five.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Then you wrote the treble clef sign on the stave and asked 
      them what that symbol was called. Again, they responded quickly 
      by saying it was a G clef.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "I found it helpful when you asked them, 'Do you know why 
      it's called a G clef? What word is this?' as you wrote 'Good' on the 
      chalkboard, with a scrolled capital G. You explained that the G clef 
      is a sort of old-fashioned G.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Then you pointed to the circular part of the clef and pointed 
      to the second line up and asked them the name of the note written 
      on that line. With a smile of recognition, the children gleefully 
      responded, 'G.' And you praised them. Then you simply played it for them and they sang it," added the student.
    </p>
    <div style="visibility: hidden; height: 0; width: 0;" id="page0053" title="pagetype_txt">
    </div>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "That's very good," said the choirmaster. "If they hadn't 
      known the answers to those questions, I may have had to tell 
      them, but there's nearly always someone in the group who does 
      know. They are proud to share their knowledge with the other 
      children. You noticed that even when I was writing on the chalkboard, I kept their attention occupied by asking them questions."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Yes, and every time the children sang that G, you pointed to 
      the note on the chalkboard," said the student. "Sing-See, SeeSing. That's Wheel 4!"
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Well done! Now let's get on to the third part of this first 
      step. 
    </p>
    <h4 class="cl-h1-l-v1">
      Step 1C: Learning singing techniques
    </h4>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "What was the third thing I taught them while they were 
      singing just one note?"
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Let's see," said the student, consulting his notes. "The first 
      thing you asked them to do was to sustain the note for four 
      counts, coming off on the fifth count as you pointed to your 
      thumb. "
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Yes, but did I keep it just to four beats?"
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "No, you extended it to five, six, or sometimes up to nine 
      beats, coming off on the tenth. All the while you were counting on 
      your fingers. That helped their breathing technique, which you 
      taught them later. The children really got the message about the 
      length of a note. They had no problem with sustaining long notes 
      for their correct length, unlike many children's choirs I've heard."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "And the second point?" asked the choirmaster
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "You taught them the beginnings of written notation, introducing the stave, the clef and the note G. They got that message, 
      too."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Why did they get the message?"
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Because you taught them one thing at a time-Wheel 3!"
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Right! Now let's get on to the third part. What was that?" 
      asked the choirmaster.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "There were so many things," answered the student. "You 
      taught them how to breathe, how to open their mouths with wellshaped lips, how to stand well-the list seems endless."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Correct again! The third part was to use the singing on one note to begin to teach them basic singing techniques. Why don't I 
      immediately have them sing complete songs?"
    </p>
    <div style="visibility: hidden; height: 0; width: 0;" id="page0054" title="pagetype_txt">
    </div>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Because it presents to the children too many things to think 
      about at a time?" responded the student.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Right! If you want children to succeed-which means getting 
      every point wholly correct-they must attempt only one thing at a 
      time. Learning to breathe, learning to stand well, or learning how 
      to use their mouth and jaw in the correct manner are so much easier if they're thinking of only one note. It's much more fun in the 
      end, too," he continued. "Then they know they are getting it right. 
      They experience the thrill of achievement which is one of the 
      mainstays of my choir.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "These new children get this thrill by singing one note well. 
      The more experienced children are thrilled when they can pick up 
      an unknown anthem and sing it correctly at first sight. The adults 
      are thrilled every week by the standard of polish we can achieve 
      because we don't need to have note-learning sessions. We can 
      spend our time on fine detail. It's all very exciting!"
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Let me write down the first step," said the student, getting 
      out his notebook again.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-i-h1-c-v1">

      "Well, that's enough for today, young man. I'm going to try to

      seen it for several weeks. Come along tomorrow afternoon when 
      two fifth grade girls will be here. They're older than our other new

    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "When you can teach children in such a way that every new 
      point is obvious to them, then you really will have become a successful teacher!" beamed the choirmaster. "See you tomorrow."

      Some helpful hints
    </h4>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      The next afternoon the student found a chair and seated himself in the practice room. He had a notebook and pencil in hand 
      ready to take notes on every good thing he saw or heard. He 
      knew he was about to experience another very positive time-both 
      for himself and for the two girls who were coming. He was not disappointed.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      The girls arrived promptly and found the choirmaster ready for 
      them. The student observed that the choirmaster had prepared the 
      practice room and was seated at the piano when the girls arrived.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      After chatting with the girls for a minute, the choirmaster said, 
      "Okay, let's begin!"
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      Again, the student thought to himself, "He makes the singers 
      feel welcome by talking with them. But when the time comes to 
      begin the practice, he lets it be known that it is time to start. I 
      should write those two hints down." And so he did:
    </p>
    <p class="cl-l-1-v1">
      • Welcome singers
    </p>
    <p class="cl-l-1-v1">
      • Be deliberate in beginning practice.
    </p>
    <h4 class="cl-h1-l-v1">
      Opening pattern
    </h4>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      The student found that the choirmaster followed Step 1 with 
      the girls, just as he had with the two other groups:
    </p>
    <p class="cl-l-1-v1">
      • Sing one note on a G
    </p>
    <p class="cl-l-1-v1">
      • Work on the shape of the mouth
    </p>
    <p class="cl-l-1-v1">
      • Work on breathing and stance
    </p>
    <p class="cl-l-1-v1">
      • Write on the chalkboard: 
      a stave, a G clef, and the note G
    </p>
    <p class="cl-l-1-v1">
      • Point to the note while the children sing it for 
      four or more beats
    </p>
    <p class="cl-l-1-v1">
      • Count on fingers to show them exactly when 
      they should come off.
    </p>
    <h4 class="cl-h1-l-v1">
      Model question
    </h4>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      The choirmaster never told the singers anything. He always 
      asked the right questions so that the children told him what they had to do. He invariably gave them a choice of answers. It was 
      never open-ended.
    </p>
    <div style="visibility: hidden; height: 0; width: 0;" id="page0056" title="pagetype_txt">
    </div>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      The choirmaster said to the singers, "When you are singing 
      well, should your jaw be relaxed or stiff? When you are breathing 
      well, should your shoulders go up or should they stay down?" The 
      student noticed that the choirmaster focused their thinking by providing a clear choice.
    </p>
    <h4 class="cl-h1-l-v1">
      Try it wrong!
    </h4>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      The student also noticed that sometimes the choirmaster 
      asked the children to do something incorrectly to enable them to 
      experience for themselves that it was indeed wrong, rather than 
      just take his word for it.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Try raising your shoulders very high when you take a breath," 
      the choirmaster said. "Are they stiff or relaxed? Are they comfortable or uncomfortable? Now try it with relaxed shoulders. Which is 
      the better way?"
    </p>
    <h4 class="cl-h1-l-v1">
      Do it right!
    </h4>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "The children are really teaching themselves how to do it 
      right," thought the student. "All he's doing is guiding them along 
      the way. What patience he has. He's also giving them a singing 
      lesson at the same time as he's teaching them how to begin to 
      sight-sing. He's packing a whole lot into the practice, but he's 
      doing only one thing at a time. He makes sure that they fully 
      understand one step before he goes on to the next. It's marvelous."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      The student saw that the choirmaster was demonstrating, over 
      and over, his five wheels.
    </p>
    <h4 class="cl-h1-l-v1">
      Five Wheels in practice
    </h4>
    <p class="cl-l-1-v1">
      1. Be enthusiastic and the children will catch the 
      enthusiasm or passion.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-l-1-v1">
      2. Teach in a small group so each child has your 
      complete attention at all times.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-l-1-v1">
      3. Teach one simple step at a time and then combine it with the next step.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-l-1-v1">
      4. Marry theory and practice in everything you do. 
      Every note the children sing, they can see. Every note they see, they sing. The written 
      notes come alive for the children. They mean 
      something to them!
    </p>
    <div style="visibility: hidden; height: 0; width: 0;" id="page0057" title="pagetype_txt">
    </div>
    <p class="cl-l-1-v1">
      5. Be in full control. The children really enjoy 
      singing because they can see that they are making progress all the time. This is the best kind 
      of discipline. The children are doing it because 
      they want to, and there's no wish to play 
      around.

      <br />
      Singing the Great Scale
    </h2>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      The choirmaster spoke to the girls, "Now, because you're 
      doing so very well, we'll go on to the next step."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Aha," thought the student, "Step 2." He watched as the 
      choirmaster gradually added to the notes written on the chalkboard. First, he asked the singers if they knew what this note was. 
      He wrote an A to the left of the G already there.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      There was silence. Neither of the girls played an instrument, 
      so all this was new to them. To help them, he showed them the 
      notes on the piano keyboard. He introduced the girls to alphabetical naming of notes and how they were written on the staff's alternate lines and spaces. When he was finally given the right answer, 
      he played A again and asked them to sing it as he pointed to the 
      written note on the board.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Now," he said, "here's G again," and he played it. "Sing it 
      for me." He pointed to the note G. "Now sing me this note," he 
      said as he pointed to A, but did not play it for them.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      There was a slight pause and one of the girls sang A correctly. 
      "Now this note," said the choirmaster pointing to G, barely 
      restraining his excitement. "And this," as he pointed back to A. 
      He then pointed to G twice and the girls sang it twice.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Do you realize what you have just done?" he beamed. "You 
      are reading music!" The girls looked at each other in amazement for they hadn't realized that reading music was so simple.
    </p>
    <div style="visibility: hidden; height: 0; width: 0;" id="page0059" title="pagetype_txt">
    </div>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Yes, you are reading music. Did I play the note A that you 
      sang for me? No, I played G, but you were able to sing G and A 
      whenever I pointed to them and in any order. That's reading 
      music, and you did it!"
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      The student was thrilled as well and watched as the choirmaster added other notes- B, C and D-one at a time using a similar 
      question and.answer technique. "The singers tell him what the 
      notes are because he asks the right questions," thought the student. "They're getting quicker at it. They really understand what 
      he taught them."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      The student saw that the choirmaster was still mixing theory 
      and practice. No sooner was a note named than they sang it, 
      sometimes without him playing it. The theory became real to the 
      girls, noted the student. "He's integrated singing techniques with 
      sight-singing techniques."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      The student watched as the choirmaster asked the girls if they 
      were standing well when they were singing a B. One of the girls 
      wasn't and she hastily improved her stance. "Well done, Kathy," 
      said the choirmaster, encouraging her. "Let's sing that note again. 
      What's it called?"
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "B!" they answered.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "He never tells them a thing. He always asks them. What a 
      great habit to get into." said the student to himself.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      Then the choirmaster started to add notes going down from 
      G-F, E, and D, one note at a time. The girls named each note 
      correctly and then sang it when he pointed to it.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      The children found this a little difficult at first. They had only 
      gone up before. With the choirmaster's patience and clear understanding of what the problem was and the children's own eagerness to please him, they managed it.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      The choirmaster played a chord of D major on the piano and 
      said, "Now let's try singing a downward scale to `Ah'-like this." 
      He modeled what he wanted as he pointed to the notes on the 
      chalkboard. The student noticed that he insisted that the last note 
      of the scale was sustained for four counts, coming off on the fifth 
      as he pointed to his thumb. The choirmaster showed each beat 
      exactly on his fingers.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "He's not mentioned sharps," thought the student. "I'll have to ask him about that afterwards." He continued watching as the 
      choirmaster gradually introduced higher notesE, F, and G. After 
      they sang each note, one at a time as before. the choirmaster had 
      the children sing downward scales starting on those notes-E flat 
      major, E major, F major, F sharp major, and G major. He played 
      the first note of the scale and then the tonic chord of each before 
      the children sang the scale. The choirmaster pointed to the notes 
      they sang with one hand while the other hand played a very light 
      accompaniment on the piano-a series of first inversion chords.
    </p>
    <div style="visibility: hidden; height: 0; width: 0;" id="page0060" title="pagetype_txt">
    </div>
    <p class="cl-f-c-v1">
      
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "How very simple," thought the student, "but he's still not 
      mentioned accidentals, even though he's playing them.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "It's interesting to see how easily he gets the children to sing 
      with their head voices," the student thought. They are singing 
      those upper notes so easily. Clearly, he expects them to do it and 
      he keeps insisting on well-shaped mouths to take their mind off 
      how high they are going. They have no time to be worried or 
      tense. They're really enjoying singing those high notes."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      The student also noticed that the choirmaster sometimes 
      didn't play any accompaniment because the children were singing 
      so well. "If he doesn't have to play the piano, he doesn't," the student thought. "I don't know many choir directors who show such 
      restraint. I must write that down."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-l-1-v1">
      • Don't play the piano when the choir is singing 
      unless it is necessary.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      The student thought about his own brief months as a choir 
      director and realized that he never left his place behind the piano 
      during rehearsal. He squirmed in his seat as he remembered how 
      many times he had given his choir the first note. "I did it over and 
      over again," he thought uncomfortably, "but this choirmaster gives 
      the first note only once and then doesn't give it again for a long 
      time-even though he often stops to ask them a question. 
      Children really can remember notes much better than most of us 
      realize."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      He watched as the rest of the practice flew by on wings of 
      achievement. They were very attentive and responded to the choirmaster's every wish. He saw with amazement as the choirmaster took the children higher and higher until they were eventually singing two-octave downward scales from a top C!
    </p>
    <div style="visibility: hidden; height: 0; width: 0;" id="page0061" title="pagetype_txt">
    </div>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "I don't believe it," the student thought. "1 had no idea that 
      children could sing so high so easily." He sat open-mouthed as the 
      choirmaster asked the children to do something that enabled them 
      to sing still higher. "This is impossible, but it's actually happening," 
      thought the student as he sat rooted to his chair. "There are so 
      many questions I must ask him. I can hardly wait until tomorrow 
      comes. He won't get me out of his office until he's answered every 
      last one of them!"
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      The next day, the student ran to the choirmaster's office. "I 
      found it wholly amazing to see you lead those girls in that practice 
      yesterday," said the student as he moved some papers from a 
      chair so he could sit down.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Yes," said the choirmaster, "That's one of the exciting things 
      about working in small groups. You may try all sorts of things. The 
      children are excited, you're excited-everyone's excited. We're all 
      in this together. Every practice can be a voyage of discovery and 
      you may uncover gold at any time. Yesterday we certainly did!"
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "How did you learn to teach children to sing so high?" asked 
      the student.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      °I learned by watching Frauke Haasemann," replied the choirmaster. "She and I were teaching a course together. I was showing 
      some students how simple it was to teach sight-singing to children. 
      Frauke was teaching them how easy it was to enable children to 
      sing with clear head-tone. She was interested in what I had to say, 
      but I was fascinated by what she demonstrated.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "I came back here afterwards where I had a girls' practice. I 
      tried what she had demonstrated and it worked. The girls showed 
      that they could sing incredibly high. One girl sang a three-octave 
      downward scale starting from the A flat above top C! Even though 
      I'd been teaching children to sing all my life, I'd never known this 
      technique before. Frauke wrote the book, Group Vocal 
      Techniques, about it. Here, let me lend you my copy."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Thanks," said the student eagerly, as the choirmaster rummaged in his bookcase and eventually found the book. "That leads 
      me to another question," the student said. "Why didn't you introduce the subject of sharps and flats yesterday when you were get ting the girls to sing the downward scales of D major, E flat major, 
      and so on?"
    </p>
    <div style="visibility: hidden; height: 0; width: 0;" id="page0062" title="pagetype_txt">
    </div>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "I'm glad you noticed that," responded the choirmaster. "In 
      the beginning of this method, I teach the children only the basic 
      minimum of what they need to know and what they can grasp. All 
      they need to realize is that when notes are written going up, they 
      sing upwards, and when they're written going down, they sing 
      downward. You'll also have noticed that before I asked the children to sing any scale, I played the key-chord for them."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-f-c-v1">
      
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Yes," said the student, "this gave the children the basic key 
      tonality. They could not have done anything else except sing C 
      sharps and F sharps once you'd established what D major sounded 
      like. "
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "What else did I do to help them move from D major tonality 
      to E flat major tonality?" asked the choirmaster. He leaned forward in his chair and fixed the student with a steady eye.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Oh-oh," thought the student, "I've got to get this answer 
      right." He thought for a while and then said, "I can't remember 
      precisely what you did, it sounded so natural, but I can remember 
      thinking that no singing teacher I've heard ever led his singers 
      from one key to another so easily." He looked at the choirmaster, 
      hoping that his answer would please. It did.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Yes," said the choirmaster with a smile. "Many singing teachers I've heard totally destroy the tonality of any scale their student 
      is singing." He went to the piano on the other side of the room, 
      carefully avoiding a pile of anthems on the floor. "Many teachers 
      do this when they are giving warm-up scales." He demonstrated.
    </p>
    <div style="visibility: hidden; height: 0; width: 0;" id="page0063" title="pagetype_txt">
    </div>
    <p class="cl-f-c-v1">
      <img src="img/page0063_0000.svg" alt="" />
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "They play the tonic chord of the new scale while the student 
      is still singing the final note of the previous scale. The clash of 
      tonalities is awful. I really can't understand how they can do such a 
      thing. It shows such musical insensitivity. It also means that they 
      are not really listening to their pupil's final note."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      The student grinned. "Surely that's pitching it a bit too hard, 
      isn't it? They're not all like that, are they?"
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Well, let's put it this way," responded the choirmaster, "have 
      you ever heard a singing teacher do what I did yesterday when I 
      led the children from the scale of D major to the scale of E flat 
      major?"
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      The student thought for a moment and said, "No, I really can't 
      say that I have. What did you do?"
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "1 played just one chord that joined, not interrupted, the two 
      tonalities. What is that chord?"
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "It's the dominant seventh of the new key," responded the student. "I just remembered."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Well done." beamed the choirmaster. "It's so very simple. If 
      it's simple, it's generally right." He demonstrated again.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-f-c-v1">
      <img src="img/page0063_0001.svg" alt="" />
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "I also noticed that once the children found they could sing 
      scales, you accompanied them less and less," the student 
      observed.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Many teachers play the piano far too much. I only accompa ny the children when they really need it, such as at the beginning 
      of the learning process. or if they have pitch problems. Otherwise, 
      I just let them get on with it without interference from me.
    </p>
    <div style="visibility: hidden; height: 0; width: 0;" id="page0064" title="pagetype_txt">
    </div>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Playing the piano too much is a disease from which far too 
      many choir directors suffer. It can be an active hindrance rather 
      than a help. Children and adults have to battle against the piano if 
      its played badly, or sing far too loudly in order to hear what they 
      are singing. So many choir directors not only play too much but 
      they play too loud.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Oh dear, oh dear!" the choirmaster exclaimed as he thumped 
      the top of his piano, quivering again. "When will they ever learn?"
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Perhaps you ought to tell them, by writing a book," suggested the student with a grin.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "I have!" smiled the choirmaster, relaxing again. "You see," 
      he went on, "it's the choirmaster's job to wean his singers away 
      from relying on the piano. They often have to sing without it on 
      Sundays. I teach them to be self-reliant, not piano-reliant."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      Can you show me some simple accompaniments for scales?" 
      asked the student.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Yes, there are various ways you can do it. The easiest is to 
      play just a series of first-inversion chords, like this."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-f-c-v1">
      <img src="img/page0064_0000.svg" alt="" />
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "These chords give the children a firm, helpful, harmonic 
      underlay that enables them to pitch tones and semitones accurately. Not all children know what a scale sounds like, so you have to 
      help them.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      If the children can pitch well, you can try playing just an 
      upward scale in the bass while they sing downward. This helps 
      them achieve some independence of mind in order to sing against 
      another melody, which is what they will have to do when they sing 
      with other voices. Listen."

      "There's no end to the chord sequences you can use," he 
      turned and looked at the student with his direct gaze. "But what 
      does it mean if you are bothered about playing fancy chords on 
      the piano?"
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "It means that you are more interested in your accompaniments than you are in what the children are singing," answered 
      the student confidently.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Exactly! Unless you have an instinctive chord sense that 
      enables your fingers to think while you are giving the whole of 
      your attention to the children, then you are not giving them what 
      is their due. Therefore, you can't expect them to give you their 
      whole attention unless you do what?"
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Unless you are giving them the whole of yours." responded 
      the student.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Right. You can write Step 2 down now," the choirmaster 
      said as he smiled.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-i-h1-c-v1">
      Step 2 
      Increase the notes, one by one 
      until you get a great scale. 
      Sing and name each note, one at a time.

      Checking Steps 1 and 2
    </h2>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Where precisely are we in the sight-singing process?" asked 
      the choirmaster as he resumed his seat by the desk.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Well, Step 1 was, `Singing one note.' You began with middle 
      G and worked on that. You showed the children where it was on 
      the stave by pointing to it. Then you asked why it was called `G.' 
      All the time you gave them a singing lesson on stance, mouth and 
      jaw shape, breathing, and also teaching them about pulse (four 
      counts, off on five). That took quite a while."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Right! But did I do all those things together?"
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "No," smiled the student, "you taught them one thing at a 
      time. You made sure that each child knew exactly what you wanted from that one thing before you went on to the next thing."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Right again. Now, what was Step 2?"
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Step 2 was an extension of Step 1. You gradually increased 
      the range of notes that the children sang, so that they sang a 
      group of three descending notes, then four, then five descending 
      notes. Before long, they sang whole scales."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "What was the one crucial thing I did while they were singing 
      these notes?" asked the choirmaster.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "You pointed to the notes as they were sung," answered the 
      student. "Then they could see what they were singing."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Yes, that is so very important," said the choirmaster, thumping his desk. Several stray papers fluttered to the floor. "Most choir directors, when they are teaching sight-singing, do it in compartments-mostly rote-singing with a little sight-singing thrown in 
      on the side. For me, sight-singing is a continuing process. It is 
      wholly integrated into the practices. Whenever the children sing 
      anything, they have to make an attempt to read it first. Only when 
      they have made a real effort to work it out for themselves and 
      gained some measure of success, do I help them with notes and 
      rhythms-should they need it.

      "By the way," he added, "it's pretty obvious that you can't 
      possibly accompany scales with two hands and point to the notes 
      on the chalkboard at the same time. That's why my simple onehanded accompaniments are so useful. They leave the other hand 
      free to point to the notes.
    </p>

      Step-Wise Melodies
    </h2>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Step 3 is an extension of Step 2," said the choirmaster as he 
      sat at the grand piano in the practice room. The chalkboard was 
      cleaned and ready. "Do you remember what I wrote on the chalkboard by the end of Step 2?"
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Yes," said the student, taking some chalk and writing on the 
      chalkboard. "You had a succession of whole notes from G down to 
      D-a sort of great scale."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Yes," responded the choirmaster, turning around on his high 
      swivel chair, "keep those notes on the chalkboard. You can have 
      great fun with them."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Fun?" exclaimed the student. "I thought all your practices 
      were geared to work, not fun."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Oh, come now," grimaced the choirmaster. "weren't those 
      children enjoying themselves as they were working?"
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Oh, yes, they were." The student paused for a moment. "Oh, 
      I see. The fun came out of the work. They enjoyed it because they 
      were succeeding in everything you set them to do."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "I only wish more choir directors realized that," said the choirmaster sadly. "So many of them think that fun comes first and 
      work must be fit in afterwards. Their work becomes a chore 
      because it's not regarded as something to be enjoyed for its own sake. For my children, the fun grows naturally out of the work we 
      are doing.

    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "If it's fun they're after," he continued, "there are many less 
      demanding ways of getting it than spending an hour in a practice 
      room. But there is a place where they can learn and grow into the 
      secrets and delights of music, and that's here in this room with me.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "They find, as they learn more and become more skilled, that 
      they enjoy it more and more. They have fun and they develop an 
      increasing self-respect. Those qualities cannot be bought. They can 
      only be experienced.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "And this," he said, indicating the practice room with a sweeping gesture and knocking some chalk on the floor, "is where it all 
      happens!" He paused for a moment to recover his breath, while 
      the student restored the chalk to its proper place.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "You feel pretty strongly about all this, don't you?" the student 
      said.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "You know I do; otherwise I wouldn't be in this business. Now, 
      let's get on. Where were we?"

    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "You were about to tell me how the children could have funin Step 3-with those notes written on the chalkboard."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Oh, yes! Well, what we do now is to get the children to sing 
      tunes while pointing to a succession of notes on the great scale we 
      have already written down."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "How do you do that?"
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "In any number of ways. For example, I might begin by playing middle G."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "And point to it on the chalkboard," interrupted the student.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Right! Also, play the tonic chord of G major. You must 
      always remember to do that to give them the tonality in which 
      they will sing. Then I ask them to sing the notes that I point to. 
      For example, I might point to G, A, G. That's about as simple as 
      you can get, but it does involve the children in being able to pitch 
      a note going up."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "As well as a note going down," interjected the student. "You 
      already did that with those two girls yesterday."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Yes, because they were so good. I felt that I could get ahead 
      quite fast with them. They worked hard."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "And they enjoyed it." beamed the student.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">

    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Because I'm making the next step so clear that, to you, it's 
      obvious," interrupted the choirmaster for a change. "If you can get 
      the children to respond to you as quickly and enthusiastically as 
      you are doing to me right now . . . "
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "I'll have the makings of a stimulating teacher," said the student. "Right?"
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Right! Now, let's get on. Where were we again?" said the 
      choirmaster.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "You pointed to three notes on the great scale starting with G, 
      going up one note to A, and then returning to G."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Yes. If you are faithful in pointing to the notes as the children 
      sing their scales, you should have no problem with getting them to 
      sing little melodies as you point to notes on the same great scale. 
      But there's one important thing that you need to realize."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "What's that?" asked the student.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "You tell me," responded the choirmaster. "But let me make it 
      easier for you to give the right answer by ...."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "By asking me the right question." the student said quickly.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Yes, indeed. Have the children been singing by step or by 
      leaps so far?"
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "By step."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Yes! Do we want to stay in the moving by step mode or do 
      we want to launch out into singing leaps?"
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "That's easy. If you are going to stay with teaching one thing 
      at a time, you keep with step movement for the present. You are 
      about to ask them to sing up and down, which is the one new 
      thing they are about to learn."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Yes, indeed. Our object here is to enable the children to pitch 
      on their own without any help from me, one note higher, one 
      note lower. What comes next?"
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      There was an appreciable pause as the student thought furiously. "If you are moving by step, you can only go up one note at 
      a time or go down one note. There's nothing else you can do, is 
      there?"
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "How does `Good King Wenceslas' begin?" asked the choir master unexpectedly.

    </div>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Oh, yes." answered the student. "Notes can go up, they can 
      go down, or they can stay the same. How obvious!"
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Did I tell you that?"
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "No, you asked me the right question instead, and I told you. 
      I'll remember that because you've enabled me to have ownership 
      of the answer. This is great!" the student exclaimed. "I'm learning 
      so much here."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Thank you. That's what I'm here for-to enable you, the children, and the adults to enjoy a really positive learning experience. 
      But we must get on.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "I point out little melodies for the children to sing on the great 
      scale-going up or down by step and occasionally having repeated 
      notes. The children find this great fun because it's a challenge they 
      can win. It's good to have a competition between the children to 
      see who can get most notes right. They love that."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      The student wrote in his notebook:
    </p>
    <p class="cl-i-h1-c-v1">
      Step 3 
      Point out short step-wise melodies 
      from the great scale. 
      Use repeated notes, too.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "There's no end to the number of little melodies you can 
      invent," said the student going to the board. "You can begin with 
      this sort of thing." He pointed to the notes on the great scale, 
      going left and right as needed.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-f-c-v1">
      
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "You eventually get to something like this," said the student as

    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Yes," said the choirmaster, "but you left out something of 
      crucial importance in your second example. What was it?"

    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "You were so engrossed in the simplicity of what you were 
      doing, that you made the basic assumption that the children had 
      not made, and could not make." He moved over to the piano, and 
      the student stepped out of his way. "You began your first example 
      on G, the note the children were used to starting on. They knew 
      the tonality of the next note." The choirmaster played a G, and 
      then he played the A above. "They expected the note above G to 
      sound as it does because they've been singing Gs and As for several minutes. However, the second tune you asked them to sing 
      began on a C, and what happens?"
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Oh yes," exclaimed the student, "they would still have been 
      thinking in the tonality of G major, and so might have sung the 
      top note as an F sharp, instead of an F natural that I had intended."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "What should you have done before asking them to sing a 
      melody that began on a new note?" the choirmaster asked as he 
      moved away from the piano while the student took his place.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "I should have established the new tonic by playing the tonic 
      chord, and then the first note, like this," said the student as he 
      played.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-f-c-v1">
      
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "I do even more than that sometimes," said the choirmaster, 
      regaining the piano stool. "For example, if I were to ask the children to sight-sing the opening measures of the hymn "Comfort, 
      Comfort," I would play the tonic chord and then play part of a rising and descending scale to ensure that the children hear the 
      tonality. In this way, they sing in the right key. Listen."

      Four boys were gathered around the piano in the practice 
      room. For twenty minutes they were engrossed in all that the 
      choirmaster encouraged them to do-singing one note, singing 
      scales, improving their breathing technique, checking their stance 
      and the shape of their mouths, working on head tone, and trying 
      to sing step-wise melodies as he pointed to them on the great 
      scale written on the chalkboard.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      Some of the boys were more successful than others. One boy 
      managed to sing correctly only five notes of a step-wise melody 
      while another boy sang twenty. However, the student noticed that 
      the choirmaster showed that he was equally pleased with all the 
      boys. He made it plain that what he expected was equal effort, not 
      equal results, and the boys realized this, too. They all felt good 
      about the situation.

    <p class="cl-pd-v1">

    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "There are two ingredients for making music," the choirmaster 
      said as he looked directly at each boy to make sure they were all listening. "One of them is pitch. What's the other?"
    </p>

    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      Several hands shot into the air. "Yes, Luke?"
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Rhythm!"
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Well done, Luke. Who else knew that it was rhythm?" Two 
      hands shot up. "Good! Have you heard of rhythm, Chris?" he 
      asked the boy whose hand hadn't been raised.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Yes," said Chris.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Can you spell `rhythm' for us, Chris?" asked the choirmaster.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      Chris made several attempts, but didn't quite succeed. "You're 
      nearly right, Chris. Who can get it absolutely right? Yes, Brian?" 
      The choirmaster wrote the word on the board in big capital letters 
      as Brian spelled it out for him. Well done, Brian."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "That's Wheel 4," thought the student. "The children are seeing what they are saying. That man doesn't miss a trick."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Well, now then," said the choirmaster as he wrote four quarter notes on the board, "who can tell me what these notes are? 
      Are they half notes or quarter notes?"
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "He did two things there," thought the student. "First, he 
      asked them a question as he was writing on the board to keep 
      their attention. Second, he asked the question in the 'is it this or is 
      it that' format, so that their thinking would be focussed. He saves a 
      lot of time like that. If I had asked the open-ended question, `What 
      sort of notes are these?' I might have been given the answer, 
      'Messy ones!"'
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Quarter notes," said Matt.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Quite right, Matt," said the choirmaster standing up. "They 
      sound like this." He clapped four times, very rhythmically.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Now, you do it with me," said the choirmaster, and the boys 
      followed along.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      The student noted that the boys clapped very vigorously in 
      imitation of the choirmaster. It was done with purpose and energy.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Good! Now we'll do it again as I point to these quarter notes 
      on the chalkboard." The choirmaster pointed and the boys 
      clapped, following the firm rhythmic pointing of his index finger. 
      He pointed in such a way that the boys had to clap rhythmically, 
      energetically, and together as the choirmaster's finger stabbed at 
      the notes drawn on the chalkboard. "Good! Let's do it one more 
      time." And they did.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Now," said the choirmaster as he wrote a half note on the chalkboard to the right of the four quarter notes, "what sort of 
      note is this? Is it a half note or a whole note?"
    </p>
    <div style="visibility: hidden; height: 0; width: 0;" id="page0076" title="pagetype_txt">
    </div>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "It's a half note," answered Brian.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Yes, it is. How many quarter notes are there in a half note, 
      Chris?"
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      There was a slight pause, then Chris said, "Two!"
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Well done, Chris. You clap a half note like this," he gave a 
      vigorous clap followed by an equally vigorous second beat with his 
      hands still clasped.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Now you try it." he told the boys. There was a loud clap. 
      "Nearly, Chris. Let's have a really strong second beat.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "That's better. Now," he added, as he drew a second half note 
      next to the first, "let's clap both half notes as I point to them."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      The student noticed that the choirmaster pointed to the twobeat notes with two very clear movements of his hand. It was quite 
      clear that those notes had two beats by the way he pointed to 
      them. The choirmaster firmly pointed at the top of the note for the 
      first beat, and then he slid his finger down to the bottom of the 
      stem with a rhythmic jerk for the second beat. "He made it very 
      obvious; anyone could follow that," thought the student.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Now, let's clap these four quarter notes and the two half 
      notes." The boys did exactly that, as the choirmaster continued to 
      point at the notes very rhythmically so there was no possibility of 
      anyone making a mistake.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Were we absolutely together?" he asked after they finished. 
      The boys shook their heads. "Okay, let's do it again and keep 
      absolutely, absolutely together." And they did. They saw that the 
      choirmaster had set a high standard for what he regarded as right. 
      He knew they could do it if they really tried; and they knew it, too.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Finally," said the choirmaster as he drew a whole note on the 
      board after the second half note, "what is this note?"
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "A whole note!" they said together.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Yes! How many quarter notes are there in a whole note?"
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Four!" they all shouted.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Okay, who can clap me a whole note? Yes, Brian, you do it."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      Brian clapped and clasping his hands, moved his forearms vigorously for the count of two, three, and four.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Well done, Brian! Let's all clap the whole note as I point to 
      it." And they did.
    </p>
    <div style="visibility: hidden; height: 0; width: 0;" id="page0077" title="pagetype_txt">
    </div>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Now, let's clap the whole thing." said the choirmaster pointing to the four quarter notes, two half notes, and one whole note. 
      And they did.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1 cl-pd-v1_left_2_1">
      "Was that absolutely together?"
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1 cl-pd-v1_left_2_1">
      "No," said the boys.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1 cl-pd-v1_left_2_1">
      "Shall we do it again?"
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Yes!" they chimed; so they did.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Now, let's have some fun," said the choirmaster, getting busy 
      with eraser and chalk as he altered the notes. "Who can clap this 
      for me?"
    </p>
    <p class="cl-f-c-v1">
      
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1 cl-pd-v1_right_2_1">
      Four hands shot into the 
      air. "All right, let's take it in 
      turn. You're first, Chris."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1 cl-pd-v1_right_2_1">
      Chris clapped as the choirmaster pointed to the new set of 
      notes. There was one mistake.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1 cl-pd-v1_right_2_1">
      "He'll show Chris which note was wrong and get him to do it 
      again," thought the student to himself.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1 cl-pd-v1_right_2_1">
      "That was pretty good, but was it all correct, Chris?"
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1 cl-pd-v1_right_2_1">
      "No," said Chris.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1 cl-pd-v1_right_2_1">
      "Whoops," thought the student, "I forgot. He'll ask the lad 
      where he went wrong. When will I ever learn?"
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1 cl-pd-v1_right_2_1">
      "Where did you go wrong?" the choirmaster asked Chris.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1 cl-pd-v1_right_2_1">
      "On the last half note. I clapped two quarters instead."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1 cl-pd-v1_right_2_1">
      "That's right. Do it again." Chris did and was right.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1 cl-pd-v1_right_2_1">
      "Good. Let's all do it." And they did.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1 cl-pd-v1_right_2_1">
      "He's involving them all as much as he can, while giving individuals the opportunity to try it on their own," the student thought. 
      The pace was quick, continuous, and totally absorbing. There was 
      nowhere else in the whole world for these boys. They were totally 
      present in body, mind, and spirit. "That's real concentration for 
      you! "
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1 cl-pd-v1_right_2_1">
      The choirmaster gave each boy a fresh rhythm to clap on his 
      own, followed immediately by everyone clapping the same example. As the time came for the practice to finish, the director gave 
      the boys a really long example to clap. "Let's finish with everyone 
      clapping this absolutely together-right the first time!"
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1 cl-pd-v1_right_2_1">
      The boys clapped as the choirmaster pointed rhythmically to 
      every note. It was a great effort.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1 cl-pd-v1_right_2_1">
      "Was that absolutely together?"
    </p>
    <div style="visibility: hidden; height: 0; width: 0;" id="page0078" title="pagetype_txt">
    </div>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "No," the boys responded. They clapped it again.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "He didn't have to ask them to clap it again," observed the 
      student. "They knew he wouldn't be satisfied until it was right; and 
      they want it to be absolutely right themselves. He just raised an 
      eyebrow as much as to say, `Let's go!' and they did it again."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      On the second try, it still wasn't together. The choirmaster 
      didn't say a word, but gave them an encouraging look. He raised 
      his eyebrow once more, and off they went yet again. This time it 
      was absolutely right.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      The boys all stood, glowing with pride and pleasure at having 
      achieved so much. The student could see that the choirmaster fully 
      shared their feelings of accomplishment. He could see that they 
      were all in this together. The choirmaster was part of their team 
      and they were part of his.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      The student recognized that the choirmaster really knew how 
      to teach children so that they wanted to learn. It was fun because it 
      was hard work first and there was a clearly defined goal. "The 
      achievement was its own reward. What a practice!" thought the 
      student. He wrote Step 4 in his notebook:
    </p>
    <p class="cl-i-h1-c-v1">
      Step 4 
      Clap simple rhythms exactly right.

      Getting It Exactly Right
    </h2>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      The following week the student was again in the choirmaster's 
      untidy office. He noticed that a chair had been cleared for him to 
      sit on. "An improvement." he thought.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Well," said the choirmaster, "what is Step 5? It's a logical 
      step from Step 4."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      The student cleared his throat and said, "Do you teach the 
      children how to clap rests and dotted notes?"
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "That could be," answered the choirmaster enigmatically. 
      "There's no hard and fast rule about what one should teach next. 
      For example, if you felt strongly that children should learn the 
      Kodaly method, or Solfege, or whatever, you could certainly make 
      use of these admirable techniques. What is the main difference, 
      then, between my method of teaching children to sight-sing and all 
      other methods?" the choirmaster asked unexpectedly.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "You insist on everything being right?" ventured the student.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "That's very important. Many choir directors are satisfied with 
      things being nearly right. Once their children get it into their heads 
      that being nearly right is acceptable, then that is the standard the 
      choir director will get for everything. The notes of anthems will be 
      nearly right. The singers will arrive for practices and services nearly on time. They will nearly put the choir first in their order of priorities.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "There's only one way to go, and that is to get everything wholly right. From this, everything else flows-the anthems are 
      sung wholly right, practices start and finish punctually, and respect 
      for the choir is high.
    </p>
    <div style="visibility: hidden; height: 0; width: 0;" id="page0080" title="pagetype_txt">

    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Do you know," he added, "one boy came to me last week, 
      he's a fine tennis player at school, and he said, `Choir comes 
      before tennis!' I was thrilled. But he wouldn't have said it if all I 
      expected from him was `nearly. "'
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Is that the main difference between what you do and what 
      some other choir directors do who teach sight-singing?" asked the 
      student.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "It certainly is a difference, but not the main difference. Let 
      me ask you the right question. How much time do I spend teaching sight-singing here?"
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Oh, you spend the whole time. You said that every part of 
      your practice is geared to sight-singing. The children have to work 
      out everything for themselves. You don't tell them a thing," 
      responded the student.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Yes, that's the main difference. We practice hymns and 
      anthems like any other choir. We aim at beautiful tone and singing 
      well together just like everyone else. But the singers know that 
      they have to do the thinking. I will not do it for them. They come 
      ready to work. What is the end result of all that?"
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Their skills are improved at every practice by the work they 
      do. They go home feeling that they have spent that hour really 
      well."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Yes! The term is, I think, `rosy glows.' I aim at sending every 
      singer home with a rosy glow, and absolutely exhausted because of 
      the effort he or she made. That way they'll be back for more next 
      week. But let's get back to Step 5," said the choirmaster.

      Clapping from Music

    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      The choirmaster looked carefully at the student and said, "If 
      Step 5 is an extension of Step 4, what is Step 5?"
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Well," said the student, "if it's not teaching them about dotted 
      notes, I can't think what it is."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Let me ask you the right question. From where have the 
      singers been reading music so far?"
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "From the chalkboard in the choir room."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Right! But from where will they be reading music for the rest 
      of their lives?"
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "From printed anthems and song books." There was a pause. 
      "You start them singing songs from hymnals and anthems!"
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Very nearly. You are right when you say that they must start 
      singing from the printed page. Are there many differences 
      between singing from the chalkboard and from the printed page?" 
      the choirmaster asked casually.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Not really. The writing is bigger on the chalkboard, but otherwise it's pretty much the same."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Oh, do you think so?" said the choirmaster quietly. "What 
      color are quarter notes on the chalkboard?"
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "White. They're black on the printed page. I hadn't thought of 
      that. "

    </div>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Right!! What else hadn't you thought of?"
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Half notes change from black to white. There are bar-lines. 
      Alto parts that get in the way-stems up and stems down. There 
      are words," continued the student, warming to his task, "and 
      expression marks. Yes, I can see that singing from the printed 
      page is very different from singing from the chalkboard."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "You've left out several other major differences," said the 
      choirmaster. "For example, when we've been singing little 
      melodies from the board that move up and down by step, in which 
      direction did we point?"
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "You had to point right and left on the great scale. On the 
      printed page the music always moves to the right."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "You mentioned that words are a new factor. So are extra 
      staves for tenor and bass, which the young singer has to ignore. 
      Singers have to find out where to go when the end of a line 
      comes. Do they go down one line or two? In most hymnals the 
      trebles have to skip a line."

    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "For accompanied choir music, the sopranos not only have to 
      skip the men's line, but also the organ part. That's another thing 
      to be learned. Of course," added the choirmaster, "when everyone 
      has a book, I can no longer point to the music for them to follow, so we have to do something else!

      "Let me tell you what I do. Telling you isn't a good method of 
      teaching, but time is short and we need to get on. I get children to 
      share books. One child follows the notes with his or her finger, 
      while the other child does the singing, then they exchange roles. I 
      walk round to each pair to check that the right notes are being 
      pointed to at the right time. This takes a lot of careful supervision. 
      The children are not wholly secure in doing this yet. After a little 
      while, I can spot which child is doing it particularly well and which 
      child needs more help. What do you think I do to help those who 
      need it most?"
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      You put the better child with the less experienced," replied 
      the student.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Yes. Children love to show off their knowledge in front of 
      their peers. If you can organize this in a non-threatening and constructive way, you will ensure that the less experienced child will 
      try even harder to match the skill shown by the other."

    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "I would imagine that the more experienced child will also 
      improve."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Yes, indeed. That's a very perceptive comment. Do you 
      remember what the best method of learning is?"
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      It is to teach!" blurted out the student.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "I certainly learned more when I began to teach than I ever did 
      when I was a student. It's the same for most people, I believe. If 
      you can cast some of your children into the role of teachers, they 
      will improve as much, or even more, than those whom they are 
      teaching.'
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "So what exactly do you do for Step 5?" asked the student.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "I make it as accessible as possible for them," answered the 
      choirmaster. "On the chalkboard, I write out several measures of 
      rhythm from a hymn tune and get the children to clap it."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Do you use quarter notes, halves, and whole notes only?" 
      asked the student.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Yes, of course. This is not the time to introduce anything 
      new. 
    </p>
    <p class="cl-f-c-v1">
      
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1 cl-pd-v1_right_2_1">
      "Then I ask them to clap 
      that same rhythm from the 
      hymnal without telling them 
      that it is the same rhythm."

    <div style="visibility: hidden; height: 0; width: 0;" id="page0084" title="pagetype_txt">

    <p class="cl-f-c-v1">
      
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "There is always someone who realizes that it's the same. I get 
      them to clap it again-both from the board and the hymnal-and 
      then they all realize it. Then I ask them to tell me the differences 
      between the way the two rhythms are written out, the differences 
      which we discussed a couple of minutes ago. Why do I ask them to 
      tell me, rather than vice versa?"
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Because everything they tell you they will remember, but anything you tell them they can forget. You asked me that question 
      before," the student added with a grin. "That's why I remembered 
      it."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Well done." laughed the choirmaster. "You have the makings 
      of a creative teacher. You remember things. You notice things and 
      you have a good sense of humor. Having a sense of humor is 
      essential, not only to help make life more pleasant for the children 
      and yourself but also to save your sanity when things go wrong."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Do things go wrong for you?" asked the student.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Good heavens, yes! Nearly every day there's some problem 
      to deal with. That's what life is all about. It's how you deal with 
      those problems that makes or breaks you. Being able to laugh at 
      yourself is a marvelous safety-valve.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "While we're at it, there's another essential quality that choirmasters must possess if they are to fulfill their vocation and retain 
      their sanity, and that is stamina."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "What do you mean by that?" asked the student.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "A choirmaster must have an abundant reserve of physical and 
      mental energy. Choirmaster must always appear before the choir 
      radiating goodwill-even when they've had a bad day. They must 
      spread enthusiasm-even when they are not feeling their usual fervor. They must disseminate inspiration-even when they think 
      they are in the wrong business! Choirmasters must `keep on keeping on' in the face of every setback. That's what they are there 
      for-to lead from the front at all times." The choirmaster paused 
      to take a breath.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "To lead a live program," he continued, "such as we have 
      here that involves so many people of all ages, means that the 
      choirmaster must expect to meet with many problems, as well as to reap many rewards. That's why stamina is vital. Not too many 
      students realize this when they seek to become church musicians. 
      But let's get back to Step 5."

      "You were telling me how the children were clapping rhythms 
      from printed music," said the student, somewhat subdued by what 
      he had just heard.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Yes! That is a most important part of learning to read music. 
      The children must acquire the skill to follow the notes preciselyto look at the right note at the right time. I sometimes find that 
      when a child has a problem in reading a piece of music, the problem disappears as soon as I go over to him or her and point out 
      the notes myself. I don't have to say anything. I just help focus his 
      or her attention exactly where it should be."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "In other words," observed the student, "the child wasn't looking at the notes really closely. He or she was looking in the general 
      area of the notes and so was making mistakes."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Right again. You need to stay with Step 5 for a fair amount 
      of time. However, this does lead us directly to Step 6."

      "Now can you tell me what Step 6 is, if I tell you that it is very 
      closely linked with Step 5 with one of the wheels added to it?" the 
      choirmaster asked the student.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Oh dear," thought the student "this could be a problem." He 
      gathered his courage and said, "I know it's not having a passion 
      for it; that's already happening. You always work in small groups, 
      so it's not Wheel 2. You're still teaching one thing at a time and 
      you're in full control, so it's not Wheel 3 or 5, so it must be Wheel 
      4-'See and sing, sing and see, marrying theory and practice.' But 
      I can't think what it is," he ended helplessly.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "You've done well to narrow it down to the correct wheel," 
      said the choirmaster. "Just think for a moment. Here we have children clapping rhythms of simple tunes, but what's that got to do 
      with music?"
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Oh, yes!" exclaimed the student, smiling again. "There's no 
      tune coming into the situation at all!"
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Right! They're just clapping and it seems to bear but little 
      relation to music. What I do, once they are able to clap rhythms 
      without too much help from me, is to get them to clap the rhythm 
      of a tune while I play the melody with them on the piano. They 
      suddenly realize that what they're clapping has a close relation with music. It turns the theory of clapping into the practice of 
      music. It comes alive for them in a new way."

      rhythms from the printed page.

    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "How do you play the tunes for them?" asked the student. 
      "Do you play them with their full harmony underneath or do you 
      play just the melody line?"
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "You can answer that yourself." said the choirmaster.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "You only play the melody line because the harmony could 
      confuse them, couldn't it? Especially if it had cross rhythms," 
      responded the student.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "I often play the tune in sub-octaves for them, because it 
      makes it easier to hear when they're making such a noise with 
      their clapping."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "That's very simple, isn't it?" observed the student. "But you 
      had to challenge me to think before I got there."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "That's okay. I spend much of my life doing that. That's the 
      only really effective way to teach, as you now know. But I wish 
      that many more teachers and choir directors knew that. We'd have 
      much finer choirs if they did. Come back tomorrow and we'll finish 
      the whole process. We're nearly there."

    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "I thought you said there were twelve steps to learn how to

      Summary of Steps 1-6

    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      The next afternoon found the choirmaster and the student sitting in the choirmaster's office once more. Two chairs had been 
      cleared of papers and the pile of anthems that had been in the 
      middle of the floor was now stacked outside the door.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "My word," observed the student, "your office is getting 
      neater. "
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "I wouldn't go so far as to say that, but it is less of a mess. 
      Once I've finished these sessions with you, I should be able to get 
      on with some of the paperwork that's been piling up during the 
      last few weeks."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "I'm sorry if I've been a cause for your problems," responded 
      the student, rather uncertain of himself.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "I didn't mean for you to take it like that," said the choirmaster 
      easily. "We all have to do what we have to do, and you are my top 
      priority at the moment. I've chosen to tell you as much as I can, in 
      as short a time as I can, about the gentle art of teaching sightsinging. Your education is, for me, top of the list. You're enjoying 
      it and I'm enjoying it, so let's get on with it.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Run through for me, very briefly, the first six steps of the 
      sight-singing process."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      The student picked up his notebook and began to turn the 
      pages.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "No, no!" said the choirmaster hastily. "If you have to look them up in a book, you don't really know them. They need to 
      become so much a part of your instinctive thinking that you will 
      reel them off from memory. What is much more important, however, is that you will put them into practice when you have your 
      own children's choirs to teach. It has to be all up here," he said, 
      tapping his forehead, "ready to come out at a moment's notice."

    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      The student and the choirmaster walked into the sunny practice room together. The choirmaster sat on his high swivel seat 
      behind the grand piano while the student stood to one side, his 
      notebook and pencil ready.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Step 7 is an extension of Step 3-singing step-wise melodies 
      pointed out on the great scale," said the choirmaster. "Let's write 
      out the great scale now." Quickly and neatly, the choirmaster 
      wrote the notes from top G through to middle D on the chalkboard.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Why don't you go right down to middle C?" asked the student. "So much music is written around that note."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "So much bad music is written around that note!" corrected 
      the choirmaster. "I am appalled that so many choir directors inflict 
      immature, so-called music on their children's choirs that is not only 
      devoid of musical inspiration with inadequate theology, but which 
      also gives the children no opportunity to sing with their God-given 
      head voices!"
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "I see you feel strongly about that," observed the student.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "I feel passionately about that!" corrected the choirmaster again. "Don't start me on that subject or we'll be here all day. 
      Being a child in a choir is all about singing with the head voicesinging top Gs as easily as middle Gs. Very few children's choirs 
      are allowed to do this because of the deluge of rubbish that is published for them. All of it is pitched too low and their choir directors 
      seem to have no idea how easy it is to enable children to sing with 
      their head voices.

      "Recently a choir director flew over 1,000 miles to spend 
      three days here watching me lead my children's practices. On the 
      third day she told me that she hadn't realized that children could 
      sing real music. She had heard my children sing compositions by 
      Handel, Gibbons, Byrd, Durufle, Howells, and many others. Would 
      that other choirmasters realized this, too.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Although I do teach the children about middle C, I don't really use it with the younger children. Its a different matter with the 
      older children-the fifth through eighth graders-who have a full 
      two-octave range or more. They can sing both with their head 
      voices and their chest voices. But let's get back to Step 7-singing 
      melodies by step," said the choirmaster.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "I first get the children to sing a simple melody from the hymnal by pointing to the appropriate notes of the great scale written 
      on the chalkboard."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Don't you use any special sight-singing books?" asked the 
      student.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Yes. The 'special sight-singing book,' as you call it, is the 
      hymnal. It's the book the children use every time they come to a 
      practice and it's full of first-rate material that is ready and waiting 
      to be used to enable kids to read music.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "I know what you are really asking me, and the answer is no; I 
      don't waste money or time on buying so-called sight-singing exercises. Everything you could possibly need is right here," he said, 
      picking up a hymnal and waving it vigorously, "if choirmasters 
      would only take the trouble to look.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "I've been through the whole hymnal and picked out melodies 
      ethat move by step, melodies that introduce simple rhythms and 
      more complex ones, melodies that introduce accidentals, and so 
      on.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "The whole bedrock of my teaching system here is that nothing gets in between the singer and the music in the singer's hands. My aim, which is a successful aim, is to give a song to a singer and 
      say `Sing it!,' and they do!" The choirmaster got up and walked 
      around the piano slapping it as he went.

      there."

    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "So," said the choirmaster as he subsided on his swivel seat 
      again, "for the third time, let's get back to Step 7.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "I choose a tune from the hymnal that moves by step and I 
      point out the first line on the chalkboard like this-it begins on G."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "But you first play the tonic chord and the first note," interjected the student.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Well done. Yes! Here we go." The choirmaster pointed to 
      the first eight notes of "Old Hundredth" using the great scale (G, 
      G, F, E, D, G, A, B).
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "This could be the opportunity to introduce some practical 
      teaching about accidentals, if you have the time and the inclination, because F sharp appears in this melody," commented the 
      choirmaster. "That's up to you. If the children can't see the keyboard, you could leave it alone. But if a child asks a question about 
      the F sharp, you must answer it then and there; and that takes 
      time, if you are going to do it properly."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Do you get the children to sing the melody in the correct 
      rhythm?" asked the student.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "That's a good question. You give me the right answer."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "The answer is no. You would be asking the singers to do 
      more than one thing at a time. They're just concentrating on 
      pitch, not rhythm," replied the student.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Well done. But you did right to ask the question so you know 
      exactly what you're aiming for. You could, if you wished, write out 
      the melody from the hymnal on the chalkboard," continued the 
      choirmaster. "This could be an easy intermediate step to enable 
      them to translate the notation they've seen on the chalkboard to 
      the notation they will see in the hymnal. That's up to you. 
      Eventually, you must ask them to sing that same melody from the 
      hymnal. "

      "Do they have to sing the whole hymn tune or only part of 
      it?" asked the student.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Only part of it. Here it will be the first eight notes. If the children can sing eight notes right, they can eventually sing eighty notes right. But you need to get to the printed page as quickly as 
      possible. Why is that?"

      "Because that's what they'll be using from now on," said the 
      student with a smile.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Right! When you transfer the children's attention to the printed page, what must you be very careful to do? There are several 
      things. "
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Well, the first thing you must do is to play the tonic chord, 
      and perhaps play a scale up and down, to establish the tonality of 
      the music, like this." The student leaned over the choirmaster's 
      shoulder and played.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-f-c-v1">
      
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Well done, again. You needn't play the whole scale. A few 
      notes up and down are all that is needed. It would be helpful, too, 
      if the children would sing those few notes with you, just to get the 
      `vocabulary' of the notes into their heads before they attempt to 
      work out the melody for themselves. Treat it is a warm-up exercise 
      to get their mouths into the right shape. So many children sing 
      with almost closed mouths when they are working something out.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Always make the answer accessible to them, but leave 
      enough for them to work out on their own so that they can own 
      their right answers. Challenge them, but don't make it so difficult 
      that they are threatened. Once the children get it into their heads 
      that reading music is not difficult, then you will be well on your 
      way to success," commented the choirmaster.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      Without being prompted, the student added, "And the second 
      thing to do, is to ensure that the children are looking at the right 
      notes at the right time. You may have to point to the notes yourself as they sing them from the book, or else ask a more advanced 
      chorister to stand with them."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Good," said the choirmaster. "Remember that it is your 
      object to make the children as independent as quickly as possible. 
      They need, very soon in the process, to practice following the notes with their own fingers, supervised by you, of course.

      "One of the surprising things I discovered when I began teaching children how to read music was that they often have a problem 
      in distinguishing between notes written on lines from those written 
      in spaces." The choirmaster drew a G and an A on the stave.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "You mean that children can't immediately spot the difference 
      between a G and an A?" asked the student.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Yes. They often mistake a G for an A. You have to point 
      clearly to the two notes and get them to look more closely at 
      them. Do I tell them if the second note is different from the first?" 
      asked the choirmaster unexpectedly.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "No," responded the student immediately, "you ask them."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      The choirmaster continued, "You might say, 'Is this note higher or lower that note?' You may have to ask the question several 
      times before a child really sees that the notes are different and 
      gives you the right answer."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "I suppose it's similar to a Westerner being asked to distinguish between Chinese or Japanese written characters," observed 
      the student. "They all look much the same until you study them 
      closely."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "My word," exclaimed the choirmaster admiringly, "that's a 
      very intelligent comparison. I must remember that. By the way," 
      he added, "some children aren't aware that it's the position of the 
      note head that determines the pitch, not the stem. Until you 
      explain this to them, they might think that A with its stem up is 
      higher than B with its stem down. This is because, at first glance, it 
      does look higher.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "When I had just graduated from college," he continued, "I 
      was given one of the most important pieces of advice I'd ever 
      heard. It came from Dr. Gerald H. Knight, the distinguished director at the Royal School of Music in England. He said, 'When you 
      give a child a piece of music to sing, he looks at the words and not 
      at the notes.' I didn't believe him at the time, but I've since found 
      this to be true, many times."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      The choirmaster got up and began to wander around the practice room, waving his arms to illustrate his point, "One of your 
      tasks is to discover devices that will assist children to look at the 
      right notes and to follow them closely.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "There are a number of ways to help focus the children's attention on the notes when you are playing melodies for them. 
      Here are some examples.
    </p>
    <div style="visibility: hidden; height: 0; width: 0;" id="page0095" title="pagetype_txt">
    </div>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Ask them to put up their hand when you reach the last note 
      in a line of music. They won't be clapping here, of course, just following the notes with their fingers.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Ask them to put up their hand when you play the note G or 
      any other specified note.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "When they are a little more advanced and they can sing the 
      melodies, ask them to sing a note to the word 'up' when a note 
      goes up, 'down' when it goes down and 'same' when it is repeated. The first note, by the way, is always 'start'.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "This is great fun. The children love it. It's fun for adults, too. 
      So, for example, the first phrase of 'Good King Wenceslas' would 
      be: start, same, same, up, down, same, down. The children have 
      to supply the words, of course, you don't write them out. That 
      really makes them think.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Its a great device to help children learn new music at the 
      early stage of your introducing a sight-reading program to your 
      choir. You don't need to use it when their reading is really established. But at this early stage you can play the melody through 
      with them several times as you use the ideas I've just given you," 
      continued the choirmaster. "They hear it several times, but 
      throughout this process, the children are thinking, they are not just 
      being fed mindlessly with notes, as so many of them are, alas."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      He began thumping the top of the piano again to show how 
      opposed he was to choir directors who teach their children by 
      rote. "All these devices help to focus the children's attention on 
      the right note at the right time and thus, they will be learning a little better at each attempt how to read music."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "That's fascinating," said the student. "I'd love to try that 
      when I get my own choir. It's all very simple, but it works. I've 
      heard your big choirs singing and every singer knows exactly what 
      he or she is doing. They are all trained musicians. But where are 
      we in Step 7?" asked the student. "We've been talking about so 
      many other things as well."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Yes," agreed the choirmaster. "Although I try to put things in 
      nice neat boxes, there are always a host of other things that need 
      to be said. Step 7 in a nutshell goes like this.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "1. Get the children to sing a step-wise melody to 'Ah', or some other tone-producing vowel, while you point out the tune to 
      them from the great scale. That's the same as Step 3.

    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "2. Get them to sing the same melody from the printed page 
      in the hymnal; it need only be a few measures. Thus, the children 
      are introduced to singing from the printed page.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "3. Remember to take no notice of rhythm at this stage. Just 
      get the pitch right, so take it slowly."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "You must always preface the children's singing by playing the 
      tonic chord and a few notes of the scale, up and down," added the 
      student.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Well done, indeed! That sums up the essence of Step 7. Now 
      let's race along through the remaining steps."

      The choirmaster said to the student, "Step 8 is a simple extension of Step 7. What do you think it is?"
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Well," said the student, comfortable in his productive relationship with the choirmaster that enabled him to take his time when 
      thinking out loud, "the children are singing from the printed page 
      by now. They are singing the pitch of notes accurately. So it 
      seems to me that they now need to be able to sing those same 
      notes in rhythm."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Hole in one!" exclaimed the choirmaster. "But would you 
      expect the children, once they'd sung the pitches correctly, to add 
      the rhythm to those notes immediately?"
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "I expect some of the brighter children could," mused the student, "but it might be wiser to approach the joining together of 
      pitch and rhythm a little more cautiously."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Right again! If you do have a bright bunch of children, by all 
      means let them have a go at singing the melody in pitch and 
      rhythm straight away. Children must always be permitted to go at 
      their own pace. That is true if their pace is fast, as well as if their 
      pace is slow. Let the bright children leap ahead. This will show the other children what they will be able to do. Never hold children 
      back; it discourages them. The bright ones need to be encouraged 
      as much as the less gifted."

    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "What do you do with the children who outgrow your learning 
      classes?" asked the student.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Once they've learned what they needed to know in that particular class, I promote them to the next grade up where they can 
      be with slightly older and more experienced children. But that's a 
      subject we must deal with when I show you just how simple it is to 
      train a choir if you know the great secret!"
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "I thought we'd already discussed the great secret," said the 
      student."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Yes," interrupted the choirmaster. That was one of the two 
      great secrets. The second great secret is even more important. I 
      only wish I'd known it when I first became a choirmaster, but I had 
      to wait for many years until I discovered it. We'll go into all that 
      very thoroughly at another time. We will talk about everything else 
      you've ever wanted to know about how to train a really first rate 
      choir and have your choir stalls overflowing with enthusiastic 
      singers."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "You ought to write a book in which you reveal with all these 
      other secrets."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "I have, don't you remember?"
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Oh, right." replied the student.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Let's stick to the sight-singing right now," said the choirmaster. His eyes twinkled at the prospect of revealing still more gems 
      to this student who was so obviously destined for great things.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "I can hardly wait," exclaimed the student as he walked round 
      the piano, banging on the lid in his excitement.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Let's finish Step 8," said the choirmaster. "There isn't room 
      for both of us to go charging around this room like a couple of 
      windmills that are out of control!"
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Sorry," said the student, relaxing once more with his elbows 
      on the closed lid of the grand piano.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Never apologize for being enthusiastic. There's too little of it 
      around as it is. You can only communicate with your children if 
      you are enthusiastic and really believe in what you want to teach 
      them."

    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Yes, indeed! We were discussing how to introduce rhythm 
      into the singing of the pitch of the melody the children had just 
      worked out. Or rather, into the singing of part of a melody," said 
      the choirmaster correcting himself. "You need only deal with two 
      or three measures at a time. If a child can sight read two measures 
      correctly, he or she has the potential to sight read the whole of 
      Messiah. But you needn't do all that in one practice just to prove 
      your point."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Agreed," said the student. "How do you introduce the matter 
      of rhythm once the pitch is correct?"
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Well, I just go back to Step 4."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Clapping rhythm," interjected the student.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Yes, clapping rhythm. Once the child has sung the two or 
      three measures in correct pitch for me, I then ask him or her to 
      clap the rhythm of the same few measures Once the child realizes 
      that there are two separate and distinct ingredients to this process, 
      we can then begin to put pitch and rhythm together."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Do you find that children do this easily?"
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "It varies," said the director. "Some get it right straight away, 
      but others need leading very gently, sometimes note by note, 
      before they really get it. Help them get the first note right, then 
      the first two, then the first three, and so on. It's like learning to 
      ride a bicycle," he continued. "Some children can steer a fairly 
      straight course down the road almost at once, but others seem to 
      find themselves always going into the nearest thorn bush. You just 
      have to be sensitive. By the way, which one of the five wheels do 
      you need to keep in front of your eyes?"
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      The student thought for a moment and said, "Get one thing 
      right at a time."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Yes, indeed. If the child cannot get the first note in rhythm, 
      then there's no point in going on to the second note. So this is 
      where it is particularly important to work with small groups of children, for each one will need your individual attention at this point 
      in the learning process.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "I often find that children like to be given a couple of chances 
      to get something right before you go on to the next child in the 
      group to see if he or she can get it right. Once you've established 
      friendly rivalry between well-matched children in a small group, 
      their will to win is whetted and they try even harder to get it right."
    </p>
    <div style="visibility: hidden; height: 0; width: 0;" id="page0100" title="pagetype_txt">
    </div>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "What do you do with a child who doesn't seem to be able to 
      keep up?" asked the student.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Your question shows a quick sensitivity that marks you out as 
      a caring teacher," observed the choirmaster. The student glowed, 
      but tried not to show it.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "The child who can't keep up with the rest of the children 
      should be given an individual, immediate goal to fulfill in front of 
      his or her peers that can be achieved. For example, if the other 
      children are working at getting two measures correct in both pitch 
      and rhythm, the other child might be asked to sing just the first 
      note correctly. You could say, 'Bill, I want you to sing the first note 
      to 'Ah' for two beats and show us all just what a splendid mouth 
      shape you have!' When he does it, you say to the other children, 
      'Now I want you to sing the first two measures with mouths as 
      beautifully shaped as Bill's.'
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "And then," continued the choirmaster, "once the other children have that little melody right, you say, `And now we'll finish by 
      all of us singing it together.' Bill joins in with the rest of them and, 
      more often than not, he finds himself singing it correctly. How did 
      this happen, when he couldn't do it right before?"
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "I have no idea," said the student. "Could it be because he has 
      listened to the others and learned from them?"
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "There's a lot of truth in that," answered the choirmaster. "By 
      the way," he continued, "when the children are singing on their 
      own, what must you ensure?"
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "You must ensure that the other children are fully occupied."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Yes, you must insist that they follow the notes with their fingers in their own copies of the music while another child is singing 
      on his or her own. Children will turn off at the slightest excuse. 
      They are like adults in that respect, so this calls for constant vigilance on your part."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      Quickly, the student responded, "That's why you like working 
      in small groups. You can keep your eyes on everybody to ensure 
      that they are all doing what you expect them to do."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Yes, it's a constant battle, but if you tell the children very 
      clearly what is expected of them, they will tend to respond to you 
      if you really show that you mean what you say. If you let them 
      begin to get away with inattention, having told them that you 
      expect attention, they'll immediately sense that you don't really mean what you say. They will push your boundary as far as they 
      can. Once you're in that position, you're on a very slippery slope. 
      Always mean what you say and follow it through!

      "It's much kinder to the children when you are consistent in 
      this way. Choir directors who say one thing, but let their children 
      get away with unhelpful behavior, are being grossly unfair to the 
      children. The children have no idea where they stand. Children 
      respect firmness, as do adults, and that's the only way you can 
      hope to build up a fine choir.

      "Discipline means not only well-ordered behavior, but its root

      choirmaster paused and wiped his brow after this speech.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      There was a silence. The student was very impressed by what 
      he had just heard. Nobody had told him about these matters 
      before and he knew he wanted to learn much more about this 
      vital, practical subject. Perhaps it would be in the choirmaster's 
      book.

    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      The student spoke, "You haven't told me why Bill was able to

      "This is one of the great deceptions in choir training many 
      choir directors fall for, I fear," said the choirmaster seriously. 
      "Children are great imitators. You would be amazed at how quickly children can follow a tune played on the piano. They can sing 
      each note so quickly after you've played it that you believe they are 
      reading the tune. Instead, they are really following what you play.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Young Bill was not singing with the children, he was singing 
      after them. He did it so quickly that he and the others didn't realize 
      it. Alas, more often than not, the choir director doesn't realize it 
      either."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "That's why you can teach sight-singing effectively only in 
      small groups," observed the student. "You need only one or two 
      children in a choir who can sight-sing and everyone else follows 
      them and the choir director doesn't realize it."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Yes, indeed! The choir director becomes fooled that all the 
      children can read music, whereas it's only a very few, perhaps 
      those learning an instrument, who are doing all the work. Leaders are wonderful people, and we all need them. Part of our task here 
      is to train singers to lead. Once you have a couple of strong leaders, you've got yourself a choir. But when those leaders are 
      absent, you realize that the choir isn't as good as you thought it 
      was.

      "This is where working in small groups can be such a marvelous help. In small groups you are training people to think for 
      themselves, not just to follow mindlessly what others are doing. 
      Not too many choir directors do that, I fear," the choirmaster 
      added sadly.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Now that I've been watching you at work and talking with 
      you," said the student, "I should be more aware of some of the pitfalls to avoid and know which straight paths I should follow."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "If that weren't true. I would have been wasting my time," said 
      the choirmaster, raising his eyebrows to his receding hairline. "But 
      I don't think I've been wasting my time. How do I know that?"
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Because I've been responding to you all through," answered 
      the student quickly. "You haven't just sat me down and talked at 
      me, you've talked with me and required from me a response to 
      everything you've said."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "That's how all children's practices should be run," said the 
      choirmaster, "but how few of them are." He paused for a moment 
      and then went on. "We're nearly done. Let's get on to Step 9."

      in Rhythm
    </h2>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "There's one ingredient we have not yet introduced into this 
      matter of singing hymns and songs," said the choirmaster as he 
      turned on his swivel stool and began to clean the chalkboard. 
      "What is it?"
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      The student thought for a moment and said, "The children are 
      singing the pitch and the rhythm correctly by now. It could be that 
      they need to pay attention to expression. No, that's possibly more 
      advanced. Oh, I know," he said, slapping his knee rather hard. 
      "They haven't yet dealt with the words!"
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Right yet again! This is something entirely new and it needs 
      to be integrated gently, firmly, and very clearly into the situation."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "How do you do that?" asked the student, rubbing his sore 
      knee.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "You do it by combining it with Step 4.'
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Clapping rhythm," interjected the student confidently.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Clapping rhythm, indeed! You get the children to clap the 
      rhythm of an easy hymn tune. Only a few measures are needed. 
      Don't attempt the whole tune unless they are very bright. They'll 
      be good at this by now and should be able to do it right, first time.

      "Then you ask them to read the words, normally. Have them 
      read just the words under the first few measures. Then ask them if 
      they can clap the rhythm while they speak the words in rhythm."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "That's pretty easy, isn't it?"
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Surprisingly, it's not. A number of children experience real 
      problems when you put clapping and speaking together. It's like 
      rubbing your tummy with one hand while you pat your head with 
      the other. They can get really tied up in knots. So you need to 
      proceed slowly and with a lot of care."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "How do you do that?" asked the student.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Let me list just three ways for you," said the choirmaster.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      " 1. You can get the children to read the words in rhythm 
      while you clap yourself.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "2. You can divide the group in half, one half reads while the 
      other claps, then change over.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "3. If you have a small group where there's a happy spirit of 
      cooperation, you can ask one child to speak the words in rhythm 
      while the others clap. Continue round so that each child has a 
      turn. Once one child has it right, all the children will be able to do 
      it. "
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Because children can imitate so quickly." the student said 
      confidently.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Yes, but let them enjoy their triumph with that particular 
      phrase and then go on to another one. We aren't in the business 
      of having children copy what others do but to help them think for 
      themselves and come up with a solution to their musical problems."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "I imagine that once children have the idea of speaking words 
      in rhythm, it gets easier and easier for them," the student added.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Yes, it does. But you also have to realize just what children 
      are being asked to do when you set them this challenge. How 
      many things are they looking at when they speak words in 
      rhythm?"
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Obviously, they are reading the line of words," began the student.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Yes, and be aware that words printed under a melody often 
      look very different from words printed in a book. Why is that?"
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      The student thought for a moment and said, "When you have 
      a song with a number of stanzas, the words are printed in rows with the first stanza at the top, the second underneath, and so on. 
      The children must be able to find the right line to go to when they 
      reach the end of the first line.'
    </p>
    <div style="visibility: hidden; height: 0; width: 0;" id="page0105" title="pagetype_txt">
    </div>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Yes, and as you sing the second and third stanzas, the words 
      get progressively further away from the notes. That can make 
      singing a new song very tricky.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "That's the second thing about reading a song," continued the 
      choirmaster. "The children have to look at two lines at oncewords and music. Unless you are very firm, they will look at the 
      words only and not the notes."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "I hadn't realized how many different things we are asking 
      children to do when we put a new song in front of them." said the 
      student.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "That's not all," continued the choirmaster. "You haven't told 
      me why the words themselves look different on a music page as 
      opposed to a storybook page."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "The words under music are hy-phen-a-ted," enunciated the 
      student very clearly. "That changes their appearance drastically. I 
      imagine that some children would have a real problem with that."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "They do indeed. Even with simple words like 'sing-ing,' 'people' or 'foun-da-tion.' Also, in many churches, children have to 
      tackle Elizabethan English, which is a whole different problem. Ask 
      a child what 'trespass' means and she'll tell you every time that it 
      means `you mustn't go onto other people's property;' and of 
      course, she's right."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "But all these problems can be handled if you tackle just one 
      thing at a time." laughed the student.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "You've got it! Let's go on to Step 10."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Not before I've written down Step 9." said the student, getting busy with his pencil.

      Putting It Together
    </h2>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      The student eagerly responded, "Let me see. The children are 
      singing the notes in pitch and rhythm. They are speaking the 
      words in rhythm. The next step must be putting all three elements 
      together so they can sing the words in pitch and rhythm."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Yes," answered the choirmaster. "You ask them to put 
      together the three separate and distinct ingredients that go to 
      make up a song. You ask them to attempt just one or two measures at a time so that they are more likely to succeed rather than 
      fail. Set them a goal they can achieve, rather than one which they 
      cannot. "
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "That's Wheel 3," observed the student. "Teach one simple 
      step at a time."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Yes. You can spend a lot of constructive time working on 
      two or three measures of a song; but do you remember what else 
      we've been doing while we've been teaching them to sight sing?"
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "You integrate everything else that a singer needs to know, 
      such as breathing, stance, vocal production, and so on. You don't 
      teach sight-singing in a vacuum, you give them the whole package, 
      -)ne thing at a time."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Right! Once the children have reached this step of combining words, pitch, and rhythm, you've achieved what you set out to do. 
      They are reading music for themselves. It doesn't matter that the 
      music is simple. Once they can tackle simple music successfully, 
      with continual practice, they will be able to sing increasingly complicated music."

      reading music right now!"

      The student thought furiously about what could have been 
      omitted from the teaching method the choirmaster had presented 
      so clearly. "I mentioned that singing with expression should be 
      taught at some time," volunteered the student.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "True. What note values haven't we touched on yet?"
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Oh, lots of them. Eighth notes, dotted notes, rests, and, of 
      course, we haven't really mentioned sharps and flats ......
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "And naturals," interrupted the choirmaster, "and slurs and 
      ties and repeat marks and time signatures and bar-lines, on and 
      on. So what do you think Step 11 is?" he asked with a mischievous grin.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Well, I suppose Step 11 is teaching everything else!"
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "You've got it! This is the step that takes more time than anything else because there is virtually no end to the techniques that 
      you can teach. But you will find that if you've taught the basic 
      techniques thoroughly, the more advanced matters will come more 
      easily. "

      The choirmaster continued, "Do not tell the children that a dot 
      adds one beat to a note, because it clearly doesn't-except for half 
      notes. You may have to do some unlearning here. Many children 
      are poorly taught about dotted notes in school and elsewhere.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Show them, very clearly, with lots of written examples on the 
      board, that a dot makes a note longer by an extra half of its 
      length. This is a concept that young children will find difficult to 
      grasp at first. Have them tell you why a dotted half note is worth 
      three beats and why a dotted whole note is worth six beats.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "I often continue after that by saying, 'Suppose you could dot 
      a number 8, how many beats would it be worth? Suppose you 
      could dot a number 10,' and so on. I also show them what a dotted Jill looks like: Jill plus half-of-Jill, or what Jill will look like in a 
      few years' time.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Give them plenty of clapping exercises with dotted half and 
      whole notes, and they really will get the idea."

    <h4 class="cl-h1-l-v1">
      Teaching eighth notes
    </h4>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Yes, you are right. Before you can touch dotted quarter 
      notes, you have to enable the children to clap eighth notes. This 
      part is easy. Ask them the right question: 'How many eighths in a 
      quarter?' If they aren't sure, show them what an orange looks like 
      when cut in half, in quarters, and in eighths. You don't need a real 
      orange, you can draw it on the chalkboard. Use visual teaching as 
      much as possible so as to get the message home.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Once they have grasped the concept of eighths as being half 
      the size of quarters and therefore they go twice as fast, you can 
      start incorporating pairs of eighths into your rhythmic clapping,

      so on. Move the note values around from group to group. That 
      really makes the children concentrate and they learn a great deal 
      from this practical exercise. You might also like to introduce `time 
      names' (Ta-aa, and so forth) which many children learn at school.

      are the same. Then show them that to clap dotted quarters, they 
      need to feel the dot, as they felt the first tied eighth. All this will 
      take time and much patience on your part, and you may have to 
      repeat your instruction the next time you see them. But once 
      they've got it, they've got it."

      Accidentals

      "How do you teach accidentals?" asked the student.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Ah, yes. Accidentals," said the choirmaster smiling. "I almost 
      forgot about them. Teaching accidentals needs the use of the keyboard to show the singers how an accidental affects a note. Show 
      them the rise or fall of a half step and then get them to sing them. 
      Mix theory and practice as you have been doing for all your other 
      teaching and the message will come through clearly."

      Rests

    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "In many schools the clapping of rests is done by showing a 
      `hands apart' stance (like saying, `I don't know'). I don't think 
      much of this. It doesn't give the rest any feeling of rhythm.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "What I do, and what the boys and girls love, is to get them to 
      mark a one-beat rest by digging themselves in the ribs with both 
      elbows-hard, like imitating the flapping of wings of a duck.
    </p>

      "Yes, of course it would. But, because you have the children 
      on your side through your constructive relationship that has been 
      developing over the weeks, you can get them to turn off the grunts 
      when necessary. Allow them to do it once, with grunts for the fun 
      of it, and then to do the dig-in-the-ribs silently."

      Teaching intervals-The Third
    </h4>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "The first interval you can teach is that of the third. In 
      England, there's a bird called the cuckoo that sings a falling minor 
      third. Children can quickly grasp this and can learn to pitch falling 
      minor thirds from any note. You need to remember 
      to give them the first note and the tonality. If you 
      were to ask them to sing a falling minor third from B, 
      you wouldn't play the chord of E minor for them, but either E 
      major or G sharp minor. Thus, the note they have to find is 
      already somewhere in the chord they've been given.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-f-c-v1">
      <img src="img/page0112_0001.svg" alt="" />
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "From this step you can then move to the hymnal and find 
      examples of falling minor thirds. Explain to the children that thirds 
      go from space to adjoining space, or line to adjoining line. Show 
      them on the keyboard why they are called thirds. Some children 
      think of them as the fraction one-third, which is entirely mistaken.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Now the interesting thing is that the children can also pitch 
      major thirds in the same way. If you give them B again and ask for 
      a major third, you'll get it if you play the chord of G major to 
      establish the tonality.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Having got this far, you need to tackle rising thirds. Clearly if 
      cuck-oo' is a falling third, then a rising third must be 'oo-cuck'."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      The student laughed. That was a good one! But he could see 
      that it would work, if the concept were introduced patiently, one 
      step at a time with plenty of visual aids and practical examples.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      The choirmaster continued, "The children can spot them very 
      easily in hymn tunes that you will have selected-where there are 
      cuck-oos' and where there are 'oo-cucks.' Get them to sing the 
      tunes to 'la' but to change to the bird call, 'cuck-oo' or 'oo-cuck,' when necessary. Here, try singing this section."

      Other intervals

    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "If you have come this far, you will find that children are able 
      to begin to pitch other intervals fairly accurately, especially if you 
      play the harmonic basis of the song with them as they sing. But 
      what will you not do?"
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "You won't play the melody with them," answered the student.

    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Why not?"
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Because the children, being quick imitators, will follow what 
      you play a fraction of a second after you've played it, and so they 
      won't be exercising their sight-singing technique. They won't be 
      thinking, they'll be following."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Yes, and how many choir directors do you think play the 
      tune for their singers?"
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "About 99 percent, I should think," said the student with a 
      grin.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "I'm afraid you're right. That's why most children in choirs 
      can't sight-sing. The choir director is doing all the work for them. 
      You know that singers will let their choir directors work as hard as 
      possible; its a subliminal game with them-'If he wants to work 
      that hard, let him.' You've watched me long enough, what is my 
      game?"
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "To make the singers work as hard as possible so that they will 
      improve every time they're with you." responded the student 
      quickly.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Yes, indeed! But let's get back to the teaching of intervals.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "I encourage my singers to look at the notes they are singing 
      and also at the notes they have sung. Frequently, you'll find in 
      music that a tune leaps to a note that the singer has already sung. 
      If the singer can be trained to look out for these moments, then 
      the singing of intervals becomes much easier. The example that 
      comes readily to mind is that familiar hymn tune, `Old Hundredth,' 
      that begins like this."

    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Young children have no problem at all in pitching the sixth 
      note because they've already sung it twice. Once you begin teaching the singing of intervals like this, you'll find that the singers can 
      quickly grasp it, and they begin to make all sorts of connections 
      with other notes. For example, the next phrase in `Old Hundredth' 
      has another leap of a fourth that goes to a note they've not yet 
      sung."

      two Bs they've just sung. Get them to sing B and C in sequence 
      several times, then they will be able to sing that phrase correctly. 
      From this basic skill they will gradually build up greater skills as 
      time goes on. But, again I remind you, don't play the melody with 
      them, or all your work in teaching them to sight read will go for 
      nothing. "

    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Certainly. The melody moves by step, except for the two 
      leaps that we've already dealt with. All you need is a clear bass line 
      to give the harmonic structure of the melody. You'll have noticed three other things about the bass. First, I keep the quarter note 
      pulse going on longer notes. Second, I'm playing detached so that 
      the singers can hear themselves easily. What is the third thing?"

      "That's about it, I think," said the choirmaster as he got up 
      from his swivel stool and led the way out of the practice room.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "What about Step 12?" asked the student, hurrying after him. 
      "You haven't told me about that."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Oh, you can work that out for yourself as you have all the 
      other steps," said the choirmaster as he turned out the lights and 
      prepared to lock the door. "I'll give you a hint. If a singer has sung 
      a middle G quarter note correctly once, does that ensure that he or 
      she will always sing that note correctly?"
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "No, of course not," answered the student.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "No, indeed. We all make mistakes. We all forget some of 
      what we have learned and we need to be reminded again and 
      again. So what is Step 12?"
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Step 12 is doing everything we've learned over and over 
      again-whenever we need to or when we've forgotten what we 
      thought we knew," said the student laughing.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Quite right," said the choirmaster as he walked towards his 
      car. "You can use any one of the eleven steps at any time you 
      need them. For example, if you are learning a particularly difficult 
      anthem, you might get the children to clap the rhythm while you 
      play the melody. That's Step 6. Remember?" said the choirmaster.

      Papers littered the back seat and there was a box of music on the 
      passenger seat the student had to move before he could sit down. 
      "There are two questions I've been wanting to ask you ever since I 
      came here, but the opportunity never seemed right."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "What are they?" asked the choirmaster as he steered his car 
      into the stream of evening traffic.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Well, the first has to do with the tidiness of the practice 
      room," ventured the student.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "And the untidiness of my office," laughed the choirmaster. 
      "It's simple, really. It's all to do with priorities. Some people are 
      born to be tidy and others, like me, untidy. But the important thing 
      is that this job gets top priority because it affects so many people.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "We have 120 singers in our choirs, some churches have even 
      more than that, as you know. Take them and the members of their 
      families together, many of whom have close ties to the church, 
      and you come up with a list of 300 or more people. These singers 
      spend from one to six or more hours a week in my practice room. 
      My first priority, therefore, is to ensure that they know they are 
      coming into a well-ordered situation where they will feel comfort able and welcome. That's why the practice room is kept tidy and 
      efficient. There's a pastoral and a spiritual side to this job we 
      haven't mentioned. Neatness is an outward and visible sign that we 
      care about them, and I think they know it.

      it is I who have to live with it. I've promised myself that I'll reform,

    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Well, it's to do with the choir that I had before I came here. I 
      couldn't control the children. They gave me a really bad time. 
      There was one girl in particular whom I had to speak to every few 
      minutes. She was misbehaving, sitting down when others were 
      standing, or not singing when she should have been. Yet, when 
      the time came for me to leave, she gave me a thank-you card 
      she'd drawn herself. I was amazed. From the way she behaved, I 
      thought she didn't want to have anything to do with me."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "My dear young man," said the choirmaster as they 
      approached the college gates, "don't you realize that she was 
      `naughty' just because she did like you? The surest way to get your 
      attention was to be a bit of a pain. She knew that that was a surefire way of getting you to talk to her. That's the basic reason why 
      children are a problem in class. They want the teacher's attention 
      and they know how to get it-by being a pain. Once children 
      understand that to follow the choir director's way really is in their 
      own interest, you will have created a firm bond of trust between 
      you and all sorts of wonderful things can happen.

      "Thank you, and good night," said the student, as he turned to 
      walk to his room. He knew he had a lot to think about. It had been 
      a great experience to see such a live program in action. "I'd love

      A Dream
    </h2>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      The student didn't sleep much that night, for he had been so 
      stimulated by everything he'd seen and heard during the last few 
      eventful weeks. He found himself dreaming that he was leading a 
      choir of one hundred children in the practice room. They were 
      standing around the piano with their eyes shining as he encouraged them to sing downward scales ever higher and higher.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      Their mouths were open "deep" (jaws down, tongues flat, and 
      lips coming forward). Their breathing was well controlled, their 
      tone was like that of angels on a good day. Whenever he asked a 
      question, one hundred hands shot into the air from children who 
      were eager to give him the correct answer.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Right, girls and boys," he said in his dream. "Let's look at 
      this chorus from Handel's Messiah. Has anyone sung this before?"
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "No!" shouted the children in happy and expectant unison.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Okay, then we'll read it right now!"
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      The children eagerly found their places and showed that they 
      were ready by standing proudly, looking at him expectantly again.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Wow," thought the student, "don't they look good!" He 
      began to play the introduction to the chorus, "All We Like Sheep." 
      He played it at a steady pace, for he knew that there were some 
      running sixteenth notes coming on the second page. "The children must be able to do what I ask them to do," he thought. "I shall 
      challenge them, but only within their capability of being able to 
      rise to the challenge successfully."

    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      The children began to sing. "They're doing it right!" thought 
      the student. "It's right, it's wonderfully and beautifully right! They 
      are reading music so well, so intelligently and so creatively. And 
      they're enjoying every moment!"
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      As the children continued to sing, in his dream they merged 
      into a full choir of one thousand voices singing in Carnegie Hall 
      before a packed audience as he conducted them, accompanied by 
      a symphony orchestra.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "This is what life is all about," he thought as he waved his 
      baton ever more musically. "This is what I'm here for; this is the 
      greatest privilege and joy that I can ever imagine. I've trained these 
      singers so that they are leading themselves and leading this audience to the very gate of heaven itself through the great power of 
      music. Hallelujah!"
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      The student suddenly woke up and realized it had all been a 
      dream. "No, by golly," he said as he sprang out of bed in the early 
      morning light, "I'll make that dream come true. That's what I'm 
      going to aim for; that's what I'm going to do the rest of my life.

    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "I'm going to enable children to fulfill their highest potential in 
      music-one step at a time. I will give them a gift that will illuminate 
      them for the rest of their lives. I shall train children not only to sing 
      great music beautifully but also to be able to read it at sight!

      "Some of them will be so inspired by what they find they can

      Teaching Adults 
      <br />
      to Sight-Sing
    </h2>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      The student spent the next ten days on a concert tour with the 
      college choral society. Even though he relished singing in such a 
      fine choir whose performances were enjoyed by large and appreciative audiences, he missed his contact with the choirmaster and 
      wondered what was going on at the church.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      The evening after he returned, when the day's lectures were 
      over, he rushed to the church music building and ran up the stairs 
      two at a time. Outside the choirmaster's office he had to steer his 
      way round four large trash bags that were full of papers. "What's 
      been going on here?" he thought as he knocked on the choirmaster's door.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Come in," said the familiar cheery voice. The student opened 
      the door and stood transfixed. The office was immaculate. There 
      wasn't a stray piece of paper in sight. The chairs were empty, the 
      floor had been vacuumed, and the choirmaster was sitting at his 
      desk on which was a small pile of letters he was answering.
    </p>
    <div style="visibility: hidden; height: 0; width: 0;" id="page0123" title="pagetype_txt">
    </div>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Welcome back, young man," said the choirmaster as he 
      stood up to shake the student's hand. "How did the tour go? 
      We've missed you."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "I've missed you, too," said the student still trying to take in 
      the unaccustomed neatness that greeted him. "What's been happening here?"
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Well, as you were away, I felt that this was the time to do 
      something about my office," said the choirmaster with a smile. He 
      resumed his seat and waved the student to one of the other chairs.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "How nice to have a choice of chairs to sit on," thought the 
      student.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Last week I was talking with one of our choir parents who is 
      a company executive," continued the choirmaster. "He told me 
      that he always gets to his office two hours before the secretaries 
      arrive so that he can clear his paperwork before the phones start 
      ringing. He said it's the only way he can stay ahead.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "I've been following his example for the last three mornings 
      and found that it really works. Not only have I answered all the 
      mail that's been collecting dust for the last few months, I've also 
      cleared out all my old files. There must be at least a tree's worth of 
      paper in those trash bags out there. I feel like a new man!" He 
      grinned broadly.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "When you stop learning in this life," he added, "that's the 
      time to give up. Now what can I do for you this evening?"
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "All our talks about teaching sight-singing were focussed on 
      children," answered the student. "When I conducted a church 
      choir before coming here, I found that most of my adults, as well 
      as the children, couldn't read music. How would you teach them? I 
      suppose it's much the same as teaching children, isn't it?"
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Yes and no," responded the choirmaster, as he turned to face 
      the student.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Good," thought the student, "I'm in for another learning 
      experience. I must stay on my toes."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "First, you can't treat adults like children, that's pretty obvious. 
      The fun-and-games strategy we use with small groups of children 
      that helps along the learning process is not appropriate for grownups. Your relationship is no longer that of parent to child, but it's a 
      curious mixture of teacher to pupil, while maintaining a goodhumored and courteous adult to adult rapport. Of course, very few adults would be able to spare the time to have weekly lessons in 
      sight-singing, although you may find some who could.
    </p>
    <div style="visibility: hidden; height: 0; width: 0;" id="page0124" title="pagetype_txt">
    </div>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "The yes part of my answer has to do with what you teach. 
      The no part is how you teach it."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "What do you mean by that?" asked the student as he took his 
      well-worn notebook from his pocket.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Let's take for granted that you lead choir practices for adults 
      in a way which always encourages them to think, rather than 
      expect you to do their thinking for them."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "And not many choir directors do that!" interrupted the student with a smile.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Yes, indeed," said the choirmaster as he gave the student his 
      direct look. "Tell me some specific things you would do to encourage your adults to think."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Here we go, back to the thinking mode again," thought the 
      student. "I really wanted an easy ride this evening, but with this 
      man I never get it." Out loud he said, "There are a number of 
      things I'd do to encourage them to think. Let me list them for you 
      and you tell me how I did.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      " 1. Announce the music you want to rehearse once only to 
      encourage them to listen to you.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "2. Once they have found their place, ask them to sing the 
      first note, without playing it for them. This makes them look at the 
      music creatively.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "3. Then give them the note and the first chord and get them 
      to start singing-playing a light accompaniment.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "4. When a problem in pitch or rhythm crops up, let them 
      try to solve it first rather than have you do it for them."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Well done!" beamed the choirmaster. "Make sure, when a 
      problem does arise, that you get it defined very closely, possibly by 
      asking them what went wrong. For example, you might say: Was 
      that rhythm wholly accurate? Which note was wrong? Was it too 
      long or too short? When you have the right answer, show them 
      how they can correct it by saying: If you sing the final consonant 
      of God on the fifth beat, you'll find that that note will be exactly 
      four beats long instead of the three-and-a-half you sang before.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "If you follow that pattern for rehearsals, incorporating a little 
      basic teaching of skills each week and getting them to follow 
      through, you will find your adults' sight-singing ability will improve.
    </p>
    <div style="visibility: hidden; height: 0; width: 0;" id="page0125" title="pagetype_txt">
    </div>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "By the way," he asked, "from where will you conduct some 
      of the practice?"
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Not from the keyboard, but walking around in front of the 
      choir so that they won't rely on the piano. They'll learn how to 
      become self-reliant rather than piano-reliant," the student responded.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Well done!" said the choirmaster again. "What's more, when 
      you are standing close to your singers, you'll be able to hear individuals more easily. The better you know your singers' capabilities, 
      the more helpful you can be to them.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "That's the yes part of my answer. Always lead your 
      rehearsals in such a way that every singer will have to think, and 
      so that they will go home having learned at least one new thingboth in theory and in practice. This works as well for adults as it 
      does for children.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "The no part of my answer is how you give individual or smallgroup teaching. I find that from time to time, adults are willing to 
      come to the choir room for Saturday morning workshops. Do I 
      invite all the choir to come or just some?" he asked unexpectedly.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Oh, just a few," said the student looking up from writing in 
      his notebook. "You can get more done with a few than with 
      many. "
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Yes. Learning to read music is a technique that can best be 
      acquired by individuals working in small groups. Each person must 
      be able to visualize the pitch or the rhythm. It's all too easy to follow the singers next to you if they are better than you. And 
      because you will have to ask individuals to sing during these sessions, they must feel secure about failing in front of their peers. 
      This is more difficult for an adult than it is for a child, and so the 
      smaller the group the more at ease they will feel."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      The choirmaster continued, "I restrict the number of adults 
      who attend to not more than six per workshop. By doing that, you 
      find that others want to get in on the act. Therefore, you can create a waiting list for the next workshop which is always a healthy 
      sign.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "During practices, you can quickly spot those singers who 
      need help most," added the choir director. "Do you know how?"
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "I suppose they have a sort of blank look on their faces when 
      singing music that is new to them," guessed the student.
    </p>
    <div style="visibility: hidden; height: 0; width: 0;" id="page0126" title="pagetype_txt">
    </div>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "They can, indeed!" said the choirmaster. He stood up and 
      walked around his orderly office to stretch his legs. "This is turning 
      into a long session," he mused. "They'll also stand out by the way 
      they turn their pages," he added as he resumed his seat.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "How do you mean?" asked the student.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "What is an essential technique you must acquire if you are to 
      read music well?"
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "You must hold your copy of the music so that you can see 
      the conductor as well as the music," said the student hesitantly.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Yes," said the choirmaster slightly testily, for he was not getting the answer he was looking for. "All singers should do that. But 
      excellent sight-singers do something that others don't." There was 
      a silence. "Are the good sight-singers looking at the same notes as 
      the less skilled singers?"
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Yes, because they're all singing the same music," answered 
      the student somewhat desperately, for he was aware that he was 
      clearly missing the point.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "No, they're not!" said the choirmaster, banging his desk with 
      his fist. "The bad sight-singers are looking at the note they are 
      actually singing, or even worse, the note they have just sung. The 
      good sight-singers are ..."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Are looking ahead to the notes they're about to sing!" interrupted the student with a great sense of relief. He'd just realized 
      what the choirmaster was driving at.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "At last!" said the choirmaster with a sympathetic smile. "That 
      took rather a long time, didn't it?"
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Yes," responded the student, shifting his position in his chair. 
      "It's the same with chess players," he added hastily, trying to 
      regain some of the points he'd just lost. "The losers tend to think 
      only about their next move, whereas the winners think about the 
      move after next, or even further ahead."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "That's an illuminating analogy, young man," said the choirmaster encouragingly, for he realized that he'd given the student 
      an uncomfortable few minutes and he needed to redress the balance. "The further ahead you look when reading music, the better 
      you tend to be.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "By the way," added the choirmaster, "I said that you can 
      quickly spot singers who are having problems with their sightsinging. Do you think many choir directors have this ability?"
    </p>
    <div style="visibility: hidden; height: 0; width: 0;" id="page0127" title="pagetype_txt">
    </div>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Perhaps not," responded the student uncertain of himself. He 
      didn't want to give a wrong answer that might invoke the choirmaster's ire again.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "I phrased the question unfairly," said the choirmaster with a 
      comforting smile. "All choir directors have the ability to spot how 
      their singers are doing, but very few of them actually look at their 
      choristers while they are conducting or playing. Many choir directors have their heads firmly buried in their copy of the music and 
      have no idea what problems their singers are experiencing.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "You, young man, will need to practice looking at your choir 
      at least for the first couple of measures when you conduct the 
      beginning of an anthem and at least twice for every line of music 
      thereafter. You only make creative contact with your singers when 
      you look at them.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "I must admit," he continued, "that I used to think that I was 
      looking at my singers until a friend took some photos of me during 
      a choir practice. I found that in every picture I was looking at my 
      music instead of at my singers. That really shook me. I wish that 
      more choir directors were really aware just how much time they 
      spend looking at notes they know so well-or should know so 
      well-and how little time they spend on eye contact with their 
      singers." He slapped the top of his desk several times to express 
      his frustration.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "While we are at it, there's another thing. Far too many choir 
      directors get cross with their singers when they sing wrong notes. 
      Why is that unhelpful?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Because the choir director isn't enabling the singers to discover why they are wrong," answered the student confidently.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Right you are! Singers don't sing wrong notes on purpose, 
      but simply because they don't know how to sing the right ones. 
      The choir director who's head is stuck in her copy will not be able 
      to put her finger on the problem that leads singers to sing wrong 
      notes. She won't realize what they are thinking. Conducting has 
      more to do with the expression on the conductor's face than it has 
      to do with what she does with her hands. Similarly, the expression 
      on singers' faces will speak louder than the notes they are 
      singing-if the conductor is looking at them.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "To get back to my original question," he resumed, "how can 
      you spot the less experienced sight-singers?"
    </p>
    <div style="visibility: hidden; height: 0; width: 0;" id="page0128" title="pagetype_txt">
    </div>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "They are the ones who turn the page after everyone else." 
      said the student with a smile. "I remember some of my singers 
      doing that in my last choir. It used to drive me crazy. They were 
      never ready for what was coming next."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "You'll be able to do something about that when you have 
      your next choir to train, won't you?"
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Yes, if you tell me what you do during your Saturday morning workshops for inexperienced sight-singers," said the student 
      trying to emulate his teacher's rather challenging manner. "If he 
      can do it to me, I'll do it to him," he thought.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Okay," responded the choirmaster with haste, this is what 
      works for me.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      -1. Set a date and time for your workshop well in advance 
      and tell your choir what you propose. A two-hour session in the 
      early morning is good for your first workshop. That will enable 
      adults to have most of the day still available for other activities.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "2. A month beforehand, tell them again and put a sign-up 
      sheet on the bulletin board with only six spaces for names. Leave 
      room for extra names for singers who would like to come if someone drops out.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "3. The week before, remind those who have signed up both 
      by an announcement at choir practice and by sending them a 
      reminder card. With the best will in the world, there's always 
      someone who forgets.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "4. On the day itself have coffee and cookies ready. You'll all 
      need a break after an hour.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "5. Have ready sets of simple music that you can use to teach 
      the clapping of rhythm and the pitching of notes. You'll also need 
      your chalkboard for a lot of visual teaching.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "6. Run through in your mind the basic steps of teaching 
      sight singing we discussed during the last few weeks so that you'll 
      be able to use any one of them at a moment's notice. You should 
      be able to spot what problem a singer is dealing with, whether it's 
      being unable to visualize the pitch of the next note, or some question of rhythm or whatever. Your experience in teaching children 
      will prove invaluable here.

      • Beginning to sing music of a simple anthem.

      • Rehearsing part of an up-coming anthem with special

      "8. When you begin, be prepared to abandon all your carefully thought-out plans for the morning," the choirmaster concluded, 
      raising his eyebrows.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      There was silence for a minute as the student hastily completed his notes. "Why did you say abandon your teaching plans?" he 
      asked. "Your schedule seems so obviously appropriate."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "It is a good plan," answered the choirmaster, "but you would 
      be surprised at how many misapprehensions adults have about the 
      reading of music. They've lived for twenty or more years without 
      knowing the basics of music, and so they've accumulated a whole 
      lot of baggage that has been built on misconceptions and half 
      truths. You may find, as I did, that your first session will be spent 
      in clearing away a jungle of musical garbage.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "You'll discover where they are within the first few minutes, 
      for they'll begin to ask questions that will show you what issues should be addressed. Like every good teacher, you need to have a 
      lot of information and know-how at your finger-tips. A period 
      spent in training children to read music is invaluable when preparing yourself for the more difficult task of training adults."

    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Why is it more difficult?" asked the student.
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Because adults are more set in their ways. They find it harder 
      to take new ideas on board. Their brains are not as receptive as 
      those of children. But what you will find," added the choirmaster 
      as he stood up again, clearly indicating that the session was nearly 
      over, "is that adults will express their appreciation to you more 
      readily than children, not only for what they have learned from 
      you but also for your courtesy to them in giving them time on your 
      otherwise free morning. You will all feel good at the end of the 
      workshop and they'll ask for another one. Once you begin to offer 
      your adults such practical encouragement, you'll find not only that 
      their sight-singing will improve wonderfully but something even 
      more significant will occur."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      The student knew better than to ask what it was, for he knew 
      the choirmaster would be sure to throw the question straight back 
      at him. Instead, he thought for a moment and said, "I suppose 
      their commitment and involvement with everything you are doing 
      will be strengthened."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "It will indeed, young man," exclaimed the choirmaster turning 
      to give him a beaming smile as they reached the bottom of the 
      stairs. "The choir is a second home for so many of our adults. 
      Here they find welcome, encouragement, and security. Several of 
      them have become quite emotional when they've opened up to me 
      about some of their personal problems. They've told me that 
      singing in a choir, such as we have here, is one of the most creative, significant, and supportive activities in their lives and in the 
      lives of their children."
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      He led the way outside and locked the door behind them. "As 
      choirmasters, we need to realize just what an awesome responsibility we have toward our singers-not only musically but also pastorally. We choirmasters and instrumentalists can trace our lineage 
      through J. S. Bach to King David and beyond. What a privilege!"
    </p>
    <p class="cl-pd-v1">
      "Wow!" murmured the student faintly. He was, for once, lost 
      for words.
